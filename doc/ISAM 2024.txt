FOREWORD

On behalf of the Board of Oman Authority for Academic Accreditation and Quality Assurance of
Education (OAAAQA), I have the pleasure of introducing the Institutional Standards Assessment
Manual. The OAAAQA, as established by Royal Decree 9/2021, is mandated with regulating the
quality of higher education to ensure that it meets international standards and to encourage Higher
Education Institutions (HEIs) to improve the quality of their provision. As part of this mandate, the
OAAAQA is tasked with developing and implementing a process for the accreditation of HEIs. In this,
the OAAAQA builds on an expectation that was originally stated in the Requirements for Oman’s
System of Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ROSQA) in 2004.

The OAAAQA implements a range of External Quality Assurance (EQA) activities that aim to ensure
that the quality of HEIs, their services and their programmes meet acceptable standards. The
OAAAQA’s EQA activities include:

    •   Institutional Standards Assessment (ISA)
    •  Programme Standards Assessment (PSA)
    •  General Foundation Programme Quality Audit (GFPQA)
    •  Reassessment  Activities, such as  Institutional  Standards Reassessment  (ISR) and
      Programme Standards Reassessment (PSR)
    •   Institutional and Programme Reaccreditation Activities
    •  Appeals
    •  Review of International EQA (IEQA) applications

All of the OAAAQA’s EQA decisions are subject to appeal in line with national laws and the
International Standards and Guidelines (ISGs) for Quality Assurance in Tertiary Education as
articulated by the International Network of Quality Assurance Agencies  in Higher Education
(INQAAHE). Following the successful implementation of the ISA in 2016, the ISA Standards and
process were reviewed and streamlined  in 2023 ahead of the second cycle of  Institutional
Accreditation. The revised Standards have been internationally benchmarked and contextualized for
national priorities as articulated in the Oman Vision 2040. Extensive consultation with the sector was
undertaken and feedback was sought from key stakeholders to further enhance the rigour,
transparency and reliability of ISA system and outcomes for students and the general public. This
Manual encapsulates that system and gives guidance in the deployment of ISA activities and the
expression of accreditation outcomes, essential to ensuring that high academic standards are
assured, and the distinguished reputation of Omani HEIs nationally and internationally is maintained.

The purpose of this Manual is to present the updated and enhanced national system for Institutional
Accreditation in the context of its rationale and purpose; it also includes the Institutional Standards
and details regarding ISA implementation. All those involved in Institutional Accreditation are advised
to study this Manual carefully and carry out ISA activities as per the instructions published in it. I
hope that all those involved in ISA find the process a positive and productive experience.

HE Prof Rahma Al Mahrooqi
Board Chairperson, OAAAQA

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

INTRODUCTION

The Oman Authority for Academic Accreditation and Quality Assurance of Education (OAAAQA) was
established by Royal Decree 09/2021 on 13 January 2021. The OAAAQA replaced the Oman
Academic Accreditation Authority (OAAA), which had been established through Royal Decree
54/2010 on 3 May 2010, and which in turn replaced the former Oman Accreditation Council (OAC).
The OAAAQA is an entity with legal status and financial and administrative independence which
reports to the Cabinet. It was established to continue the efforts initiated by the OAAA and OAC in
the  dissemination  of  quality  culture and  accreditation  of  higher education  institutions and
programmes in Oman, and the quality assurance of schools. In higher education, this is achieved
through the comprehensive national system of quality management which includes Institutional and
Programme Accreditation and the maintenance of the National Register of Qualifications. To
implement this system, the OAAAQA conducts several External Quality Assurance (EQA) activities
including Institutional Standards Assessment (ISA), Programme Standards Assessment (PSA),
Institutional and Programme Reassessment (ISR and PSR), and General Foundation Programme
Quality Audit (GFPQA). The OAAAQA also assesses qualifications against the Oman Qualifications
Framework (OQF) which defines the levels and types of qualifications resulting from academic,
technological, vocational, professional and general (school) education. Further information on all
these activities, together with the establishment and responsibilities of OAAAQA, is available on the
OAAAQA website (www.oaaaqa.gov.om). This Manual is concerned primarily with the ISA.

When the ISA was originally launched in 2016, the PSA had not been implemented at the time,
hence, the first version of the ISA Manual also included Standards and Criteria related to an HEI’s
programmes. With the second cycle of Institutional Accreditation commencing for those HEIs which
were accredited in the first round (2016-2023), the Standards and Criteria were reviewed and
updated to ensure there is a clear and primary focus on institutional areas. Although the revised
Standards do not cover programmes, the ISA takes a ‘global’ view of an HEI’s academic provision
and resources, including how it designs, deploys, manages and reviews programmes in general.
The review also established the currency and relevance of the Standards and Criteria to all HEIs in
Oman based on the lessons learnt from the first ISA cycle and appropriate international benchmarks.
At the same time, the ISA process was scrutinised and changes were made to streamline the
activities within the ISA and promote a more efficient assessment of the HEI’s performance. This
Manual presents the updated institutional Standards and Criteria and ISA process and is divided into
seven parts:

Part A:        Institutional Accreditation Overview
Part B:        Institutional Standards, Criteria and Indicators
Part C:      Methods of Assessment and Analysis
Part D:        Institutional Accreditation Outcome and Rating against Standards and Criteria
Part E:      The Self-Assessment and ISA Application
Part F:      The External Assessment by the ISA Panel
Part G:      Appendices

There are three targeted readerships for this Manual: HEIs; ISA and ISR Panels and Review
Directors; and other stakeholders, including students, the public, employers, the professions,
supervising ministries, institutional affiliates, and OAAAQA staff and their contracted representatives.
While each section is written with a particular readership in mind (see Table 1), all parts of the ISA
and ISR process are included in this Manual and all those engaged in ISA and ISR are encouraged
to become familiar with the content of the Manual. HEIs must also acknowledge and declare that
they have adhered to the processes outlined in this Manual when submitting an ISA Application.

1     Institutional Accreditation

      The advantages of institutional accreditation are well-established and bring wider benefits to
       the HEI and society in general. Institutional accreditation is formal recognition that an HEI
      meets the minimum required standards and benchmarked criteria. It confirms that an HEI is
        of good standing and consistently and systematically maintains academic standards. It also
      promotes quality improvement at the institutional level and provides independent assurance
        to all stakeholders regarding the performance of the HEI. Finally, it enables an HEI to state
        publicly that it has undergone external verification and satisfied national requirements.

      The OAAAQA is responsible for the institutional accreditation of all HEIs in Oman, to which
      end   it applies  internationally benchmarked national standards and   it implements the
        Institutional Standards Assessment (ISA) process The OAAAQA’s Institutional Accreditation
       applies to all types of HEIs (public and private), HEI classifications (universities, university
       colleges and colleges) and supervisory structures (such as HEIs under the Ministry of Higher
       Education, Research and Innovation (MoHERI), the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the Ministry
        of Health (MoH) and the Central Bank of Oman (CBO)). HEIs commence their first ISA after
       graduating the  first cohort of students and every five years thereafter, resulting in an
        Institutional Accreditation Outcome, which is published on the OAAAQA website for  all
       stakeholders to access. It is currently compulsory for all HEIs in Oman to undergo Institutional
       Accreditation by the OAAAQA.

      The first ISA cycle was initiated in 2016. In 2023, the Programme Standards Assessment
      (PSA) was launched by the OAAAQA to accredit higher education programmes. This
      development, along with the commencement of reaccreditation (the second ISA cycle),
       created a need to review and update the ISA Standards to ensure their currency, relevance
      and focus on institutional assessment criteria. Changes were also made to the ISA process
        to enhance its efficiency and facilitate the automation of specific aspects of the process. This
       review resulted in a more streamlined single-stage Institutional Accreditation process which
         is illustrated in Figure 1.

1.1    Institutional Standards Assessment

      ISA is a summative process involving six Standards and 45 Criteria which is used to
       determine the Institutional Accreditation Outcome. All of the six Standards and related
        Criteria are applicable to all HEIs, and HEIs undergo assessment against all of the Standards
      and Criteria (see Section 3.1 for more information). HEIs which meet all six Standards are
      awarded an Accredited  status. HEIs which meet  five out  of the  six Standards are
       Conditionally Accredited and must undergo Institutional Standards Reassessment (ISR) in
       order to obtain full accreditation. Finally, those HEIs that meet less than five Standards are
       placed On Probation prior to undergoing ISR. More information about the Standards and
        Criteria can be found in Part B of this Manual, while the ratings and descriptors for Standards
      and Criteria are addressed in Part D.

1.2    Institutional Standards Reassessment

     An HEI that demonstrates unsatisfactory performance in any of the six Standards must
      undergo Institutional Standards Reassessment (ISR). All HEIs which have been either
       Conditionally Accredited or placed On Probation are reassessed in ISR by a separate ISR
      Panel using the same processes outlined in this Manual. The ISR must be undertaken within
      a year of receiving the final version of the ISA Report. The exact deadline for submitting an
      ISR Application will be confirmed by the OAAAQA. Only those Standards which have been
       rated as Not Met and the Criteria within those Standards which have been rated Not Met or
        Partially Met are reassessed in ISR.  If an HEI is Conditionally Accredited or placed On
       Probation after the ISR, it may be given a second and final opportunity to undergo an ISR. If
       the accreditation outcome remains unchanged after the second ISR attempt, the ISA process
         is terminated, the HEI is given Not Accredited status and the OAAAQA advises the Cabinet
      and the HEI’s supervising Ministry or entity (if applicable) accordingly. More information on
          all aspects of ISR can be found on the OAAAQA website, while information about the ISR
       deadline can be found in Section 8.5 of this Manual.

1.3   Rescheduling Institutional Accreditation

     An HEI must notify the OAAAQA of any extreme circumstances that may hinder their ability
        to undergo ISA on time, as per the stipulations in the OAAAQA Policy on Major Change
        Notification for Higher Education External Quality Assurance Activities.

1.4    Major Changes and Review of Accreditation Status

     Once accredited, HEIs have an obligation to inform the OAAAQA of any major changes which
     may have occurred within the institution and may affect their ability to meet the OAAAQA’s
        institutional Standards. These may include, for example, changes to the HEI’s governance,
        financial viability, relationship with the affiliate (if applicable), occupation of new premises or
       major student-oriented issues. Further information about this can be found in the OAAAQA
       Policy on Major Change Notification for Higher Education External Quality Assurance
         Activities.

            It is up to the OAAAQA to determine to what extent a change may be relevant to an HEI’s
      ISA Application submission, activities and/or status and whether an HEI’s  Institutional
       Accreditation status remains intact or has been compromised by the reported change(s). The
     OAAAQA may revoke the Accredited status of an HEI where major changes have taken place
        that adversely impact its ability to meet the Institutional Standards. In this instance, the HEI
         will be assigned  Accreditation Revoked  status, and may  subsequently  reapply  for
       accreditation once the impact of the major change(s) has been mitigated. The OAAAQA will
       consider the application and may include the HEI on the national Review Schedule provided
       the latter has retained its institutional licensure.

1.5    Applying for Reaccreditation

      The Accredited status is valid for a period of five years. HEIs are expected to submit their
      ISA Application for reaccreditation at least six months before the expiry of their current
       Accreditation status. An HEI which is unable to meet this deadline for valid reasons or due to
      emergency circumstances that constitute a major change (see Section 1.4) must apply for
       rescheduling of the ISA at least six months prior to the expiry of their current Accreditation
        status. If the application for rescheduling is approved, the HEI will be given the interim status
      Undergoing Institutional Reaccreditation upon the expiry of their current status and until the
      outcomes of the institutional reaccreditation are approved.

1.6    External Accreditation by an IEQA Entity

       External institutional accreditation of an HEI by entities other than OAAAQA complement, but
      do  not  substitute,  the  national system  of  Institutional  Accreditation. Any  alternative
       accreditation activity involving an International External Quality Assurance (IEQA) Agency is
       reviewed and endorsed by OAAAQA through an established IEQA process which is detailed
      on the OAAAQA website. Regardless of IEQA activities, whether endorsed by OAAAQA or
       otherwise, all HEIs in Oman must undergo OAAAQA Institutional Accreditation against the
        Institutional Standards and the ISA process presented in this Manual.

2    Overview of Institutional Standards Assessment

2.1   What Is Institutional Standards Assessment?

       While Institutional Accreditation is an outcome, ISA is the process used by the OAAAQA to
       determine if an HEI has achieved this outcome. It is an independent evaluation of the extent
        to which an HEI meets the national Standards expected of all HEIs in Oman and confirmation
        that the institution is of good standing. The ISA consists of a self-assessment by the HEI and
      an external assessment by an expert Panel appointed by the OAAAQA. The external
      assessment includes the ISA as well as any reassessments required to achieve Accredited
        status. Following the external assessment, an accreditation decision is made and published
      on the OAAAQA website. The accreditation status is valid for a period of five years, after
      which the HEI must reapply for accreditation. Figure 2 illustrates the ISA stages, which are
       described in more detail in the following sub-sections.

                                        Figure 2: Institutional Standards Assessment Stages

2.1.1  Self-Assessment and ISA Application

      The ISA process commences with the HEI undertaking an evidence-based self-assessment
        of its own performance, processes and practices using the ISA Standards and Criteria. This
         is in keeping with INQAAHE’s International Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance
        in Tertiary Education, which hold HEIs responsible for guaranteeing institutional quality,
       having quality assurance mechanisms in place, and adhering to high academic standards.
     An HEI is expected to manage the quality of its academic provision and non-academic
         activities effectively, using those benchmarks and internal and external reference points that
             it considers appropriate for its mission and institutional classification. The findings of the self-

      assessment are written up in the ISA Application (ISAA) using a template developed for this
      purpose and submitted to the OAAAQA by an agreed deadline along with supporting
      documentation as evidence. The full details of this process are set out in Part E of this
      Manual.

2.1.2  External Assessment

       Following the submission of the ISAA, the OAAAQA forms an ISA Panel, comprised of
       locally-based and international expert peers from academic, industry and professional
       bodies, to consider the ISAA and assess the HEI’s performance as described in the ISAA
       against the OAAAQA’s internationally benchmarked Standards. The purpose of the external
      assessment is to verify that the HEI’s quality assurance and improvement systems are
       effective and sustainable and produce deliberate outcomes for the duration of the five-year
       accreditation  period. The external assessment  is conducted through several means,
       including the verification of the evidence submitted by the HEI (see Section 9.4), in addition
        to other relevant information sources, such as the HEI’s website, public submissions, and
       interviews with a range of internal and external stakeholders during an on-site visit to the HEI.

      The Panel produces an ISA Report which contains the ratings for each of the six Standards
      and their related Criteria. It also includes opportunities for improvement where applicable to
         facilitate quality enhancement. The Panel also proposes the final Institutional Accreditation
      Outcome to the OAAAQA Board based on the HEI’s performance. Transparency is central
        to the external assessment process. The granting of Institutional Accreditation has a major
       impact on all stakeholders, and the OAAAQA understands that it is important, therefore, that
       the outcome of the process is clearly communicated, and that the way in which the outcome
      has been arrived at is transparent and based on an explicit, published approach that is
       applied consistently. The full details of the external assessment process are set out in Part F
        of this Manual, while the Standards and Criteria ratings and Institutional Accreditation
      Outcomes can be found in Part D.

2.2    Institutional Standards and Criteria

     A total of six Institutional Standards and 45 Criteria are assessed in the current ISA, all of
      which are applicable to all HEIs (see Section 3.1). They are listed in Table 2, while a full
       description of each Standard and Criterion can be found in Part B of this Manual. In order to
       gain Accredited status, an HEI must meet all six Standards, which articulate the minimum
      expected performance. HEIs which perform above expectations in specific areas are given
       the opportunity to nominate their good practice(s) for inclusion in the national higher
       education good practice database (see Section 9.5).

      The Institutional Standards and Criteria reflect the wider context in which  Institutional
       Accreditation operates, including Oman’s national priorities (as set out in Oman Vision 2040)
      and specific requirements (for example, national health and safety regulations, human rights
      awareness, labour market and entrepreneurship needs, and the Higher Education Law).

2.3   ISA Schedule

      The ISA schedule is based on the national Review Schedule which is published on the
     OAAAQA website and the validity of the Institutional Accreditation status. The deadline for
       the submission of an ISA Application by an HEI is agreed upon with the HEI. For already
       accredited HEIs,  it must be at least six months before the expiry of the  Institutional
       Accreditation certificate (see also Sections 1.5 and 18.2). HEIs are responsible for ensuring
        that they are aware of the ISA schedule and are prepared to submit their ISAA in accordance
       with the schedule. Deferrals or extensions are not possible.

2.4   ISA Timeline

      The total duration of the ISA is approximately 28 weeks from the date of the ISAA submission.
         All assessments follow the same timeline and the same ISA process; however, the length of
     some ISA activities such as the on-site Visit depends on whether the HEI is a single- or multi-
      campus entity. Table 3 sets out the indicative timeline and main activities associated with the
      ISA process and provides a brief description of each activity. Key activities are highlighted in
        bold. While every effort is made to ensure that all ISA reviews are completed within the 28-
      week timeline, this period remains indicative, and adjustments may be made to specific ISA
         activities where necessary due to exceptional or extenuating circumstances and situations.

3    Introduction to Institutional Standards

       This section describes the national Institutional Standards and the Criteria underpinning
       these Standards against which all HEIs in Oman are assessed. These Institutional Standards
      and Criteria have resulted from a reflective process based on a review of the previous ISA
       Standards, including feedback from the higher education sector, and the relevant supervising
        ministries and entities, in addition to benchmarking with institutional accreditation standards
      used by regional and international accrediting agencies and authorities. The Indicators for
      each Criterion are also described in this section.

3.1    Underlying Principles of the Institutional Standards

      The Institutional Standards are underpinned by the following broad principles:

       •  They represent minimum standards: The Institutional Standards presented here are
        minimum standards and reflect international expectations of threshold requirements for
         HEIs that are of good standing.
       •  They are generic in nature: The Institutional Standards are expressed in general terms
         and can be applied to all HEIs. The use of generic Institutional Standards enables their
          nationwide application. However, in the very exceptional circumstances where a Criterion
           or a sub-part of a Criterion does not apply to the context or regulatory environment of an
         HEI (exclusively in the military sector), the HEI needs to apply to the OAAAQA in writing
             for exemption from that Criterion or sub-part of a Criterion at least one year before the
         ISAA submission date. Only upon receipt of an official written approval by the OAAAQA
         can the HEI exclude a Criterion or a sub-part of a Criterion from their ISAA.

3.2    Structure of the Institutional Standards

      The Institutional Standards are organised into three levels as shown in Table 4.

                 Table 4: Levels of Institutional Standards
          Level     Name                                     Description
                         A general statement which prescribes the minimum expected level of quality in a
                                broad area within the HEI and by which the OAAAQA determines whether the HEI
           1    Standard    merits accreditation. There are six institutional Standards based on six broad areas,
                                                 all of which are applicable to every HEI. Each Standard consists of a number of
                                          Criteria.
                           An explicit statement which prescribes the minimum expected level of quality in a
                                        specific area within the HEI and by which the achievement of a Standard  is
                                 assessed. The  HEI’s  mission and  institutional  classification  are  taken  into
                                    consideration where required (e.g., Criteria 1.4, 1.8, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). There are 45
           2     Criterion    Criteria all of which are applicable to every HEI (see also Section 3.1). For some
                                          Criteria, additional information is provided about the circumstances in which the
                                       Criterion is relevant. This information appears as an Explanatory Note in a text box
                                  immediately following the Criterion statement. Each Criterion includes a set of
                                       Indicators.
                                    Detailed guidelines to assist the HEI  in conducting the self-assessment and
                                   preparing  the  ISAA.  Indicators  are non-mandatory  rather  than  prescribed
                                   requirements. The HEI may address the listed Indicators or use different ones to           3     Indicators
                                 demonstrate how each Criterion has been met. The Indicators are not a checklist of
                           how to meet the Criterion. Panels use the Indicators in the assessment of an HEI
                                    only to form a broad idea of the kinds of information to expect under each Criterion.

STANDARD 1: Governance and Management

Governance and management of the HEI ensure the effective implementation of academic and non-
academic systems and functions which support the achievement of the HEI’s Mission and Vision
and the protection of academic standards. Organisational structures and planning processes are
appropriate and consistently deployed in the context of an institutional culture of planning and quality
enhancement. At the governance level, this results in effective setting and monitoring of the HEI’s
strategic direction as well as in leadership and systematic oversight of the HEI’s academic and
administrative activities and risks. Management systems and roles provide leadership which enables
effective planning and implementation of institutional systems and the provision of appropriate and
safe campus facilities. Institutional systems are governed by sound policies and regulations and
meet the needs of students, staff and other stakeholders.

Criterion 1.1: Mission, Vision and Values

The HEI’s Mission and Vision statements clearly define its purpose, all of the stakeholders it serves
and what  it intends to accomplish in the long term. The Mission and Vision statements and
institutional Values have been developed in consultation with stakeholders, formally approved by the
governing body and effectively disseminated. They align with the national priorities of Oman and
guide the HEI in all its activities. The Mission, Vision and Values are periodically reviewed for
relevance and appropriateness.

Indicators (Guidelines only, not mandatory. HEIs may have their own benchmarked and justified indicators.)
a) The Mission and Vision statements clearly define the HEI’s purpose and long-term aspirations,
   and the stakeholders and communities the HEI serves.
b) The Mission and Vision are aligned with the national priorities of Oman, Oman Vision 2040,
   community expectations, and contemporary local and international developments in higher
   education and tertiary learning.
c) The requirements of blended or online education are reflected in the statements of intent,
    strategic goals and objectives or plans of HEIs which offer this/these mode(s) of learning.
d) Key internal and external stakeholders have been directly consulted in the development and
   review of the Mission and Vision statements and institutional Values.
e) The governing body has formally approved the Mission, Vision and Values.
f)  The Mission, Vision and Values are readily accessible and effectively communicated to internal
   and external stakeholders through the institution’s website and relevant publications, documents
   and forums.
g)  Stakeholders are aware of and familiar with the HEI’s Mission, Vision and Values, and support
    their implementation.
h) The Mission, Vision and Values effectively guide the HEI in planning and all its activities.
i)  The Mission, Vision and Values are regularly reviewed and reaffirmed or amended as appropriate
    in order to maintain relevance and appropriateness.

Criterion 1.2: Governance System

The HEI has a functional governance system with clearly defined roles and responsibilities that are
consistent with relevant national laws and regulations. The governance bodies provide strategic
leadership and oversight, and facilitate the achievement of the HEI’s Mission and Vision. They play
a key role in managing strategic risks and overseeing the maintenance of academic standards in all
modes of learning. The effectiveness of the governance system is regularly evaluated.

Indicators (Guidelines only, not mandatory. HEIs may have their own benchmarked and justified indicators.)
a) The governance system  is clearly defined and documented  in the  institutional By-Laws,
    regulations  or terms  of  reference, which  establish  roles and  responsibilities,  operating
   procedures, and any governance-level committees.
b) The governance system is consistent with relevant laws and regulations, including the Higher
   Education Law and relevant bills of implementation.

Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

c) The governance system is based on the principles of transparency, ethics and accountability,
   and there are formally documented processes to ensure that any conflict of interest by those
    involved in governance is avoided.
d) The primary objective of the governing bodies is to oversee the effective strategic advancement
    of the HEI in line with its Mission and Vision and in the interests of students, staff, other
   stakeholders and Oman.
e)  Specific responsibilities of the governing bodies include the approval and monitoring of the
    Strategic Plan; the approval of institutional policies, new academic programmes and new modes
    of programme delivery; the authorisation of the budget, financial auditors and major contracts
   and agreements; and appointment or dismissal of the most senior staff.
f)  The membership and composition of the governing bodies ensures an appropriate balance of
    individuals with the range of perspectives and expertise necessary to guide the HEI, and
   complies with applicable national laws, decrees and regulations stipulated by the relevant
   government authorities.
g) The appointment and induction of the members of the governing bodies follow appropriate formal
   procedures.
h) There  is a clear distinction and separation between the role and implementation of the
   governance system and the routine day-to-day management of the HEI which ensures that
    operational activities remain independent of interventions and interference by governance
    bodies.
i)  The governing bodies are responsible for ensuring the maintenance of academic standards and
    the quality of the academic provision of all modes of learning (including blended or online
    learning), and have oversight of academic awards (degrees).
j)  The governing bodies are responsible for overseeing the overall risk management system and
   ensuring that strategic academic and non-academic risks are effectively managed through the
   monitoring of mitigation plans and provision of resources.
k) The governing bodies are responsible for ensuring that students are adequately protected in the
   case  of major changes impacting  their programme, such as closure of the programme,
   withdrawal of the affiliate, loss of national or international accreditation or recognition, loss of
     critical human or physical resources, or other critical events.
l)  The HEI’s governance system is regularly reviewed and evaluated for the effectiveness of its
    operation, and improvements are made where required.

Criterion 1.3: Organisational and Management Structure

The HEI has an organisational and management structure with clearly defined roles, and an
appropriate division of responsibilities and delegations of authority. The management supports the
achievement of the HEI’s strategic goals and objectives by overseeing the implementation of
operational plans, the provision of resources and transparent decision-making processes. Relevant
committees are in place to facilitate and effectively contribute to the HEI’s operations. Students and
staff are appropriately represented on decision-making bodies. The organisational and management
structure  is regularly reviewed and changes are made to the structure to ensure  it remains
appropriate and fit for purpose.

Indicators (Guidelines only, not mandatory. HEIs may have their own benchmarked and justified indicators.)
a) The HEI’s organisational structure is clearly defined, aligned with its Mission, documented in
    relevant publications and accessible to staff and students.
b) The HEI has a clear management structure, with defined roles and  responsibilities, job
    descriptions and delegations of authority for management team members.
c) The HEI’s organisational structure establishes clear reporting relationships among its staff.
d)  Appropriate full-time appointments have been made to key management positions and any
   vacant positions are filled in a timely manner.
e) The management of the HEI’s blended or online learning provision, where applicable,  is
   overseen by an individual qualified to monitor education quality in these modes of learning.
f)  The HEI’s management ensures that financial, human and other resources are aligned with

4   ADRI

      There are many ways in which an HEI can set about self-assessment of  its systems,
      processes and practices. Although the OAAAQA does not formally subscribe to any single
      approach for doing this, the Authority endorses and actively supports the use of the ADRI
      method or a similar tool to facilitate a structured and systematic approach to self-assessment
      by the HEI. While the use of ADRI, or similar model, is recommended for the purposes of
       self-assessment by HEIs, ADRI is used by the Panel for the external assessment to analyse,
       review and assess the HEI’s performance. This section describes the ADRI method which is
      used by the Panel and can be used by HEIs.

      HEIs in Oman should already be familiar with ADRI as this method was used by HEIs when
       preparing a Portfolio for Quality Audit and previous ISAAs. Panel Members have also
        consistently used ADRI as an analytical tool in all EQA review activities. The use of ADRI as
      a tool for analysis is equally relevant for both HEIs and ISA Panels. ADRI can be used to
       analyse any aspect of an institution, either applied at the micro level (that is, to specific, well-
       defined issues often directed by an objective or target) or at the macro level (that  is,
       concerning over-arching systems).

       Put simply, ADRI  is a four-step cyclical model comprising consideration of Approach,
      Deployment, Results and Improvement. The ADRI model can be applied to an analysis of
      any given topic. It is an evidence-based method of determining the elements listed below.

      Approach: ‘Approach’ refers, within the context of ISA, to an HEI’s aims in relation to a
        Criterion, and how it proposes to achieve these aims. In other words, it answers the question
      ‘What results does the HEI intend to achieve and how, theoretically, does  it propose to
       achieve them?’

      Deployment: ‘Deployment’ refers to the way in which the approach is practically carried out.
        In other words, it answers the question ‘Is the intended approach being followed in practice,
      and if not, why not?’

       Results: ‘Results’ refer to the evidenced outcomes of the approach and deployment and
        offer indications about how effective they were in achieving the intended aims. In other words,
             it answers the questions ‘Have the intended results been achieved? If so, how can this be
      evidenced or demonstrated? If they haven’t been achieved, what went wrong?’

      Improvement: ‘Improvement’ refers to the way in which an HEI has reviewed the approach
      and deployment in order to make improvements that may lead to better results. In other
       words, it answers the question ‘Have any reviews been conducted, and if so, have the results
      been analysed and changes been implemented based on this analysis?’

         All aspects of ADRI are important (and continuous improvement is clearly good practice);
      however, the ISA is primarily focused on results, and the results determine whether or not a
      Standard has been Met. Results are not achieved in a vacuum. They are the outcome of a
       purposeful and deliberate approach (which includes identifying the intended results), and
       actions that have been effectively implemented (deployment) in order to achieve those results
      and sustain them in the long term.

       While ADRI provides a robust tool for the analysis of an HEI’s performance, ISA Panel
      Members are reminded that the focus of their deliberations must remain fixed on the
       requirements of the Criteria and that evidence related to the four elements of ADRI should
       inform rather than override this. What is important is for the Panel to determine that the
        Criteria are Met as a result of a deliberate effort by the HEI, and that performance is
      underpinned by systems which give the Panel confidence that the Criteria will continue to be
      Met for the next five-year period, for which accreditation is granted.

Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

4.1   Approach

     When analysing the HEI’s performance in the ISA, ‘the approach’ may be thought of as the
        intentions that the HEI has in relation to each Criterion, or ‘statements of intent’.  It takes two
       forms: what the HEI is proposing to do and how it is proposing to do it. Against each Criterion,
      an HEI should describe its approach at both a strategic and operational level. Approach
       statements may include:

       a) The HEI’s Mission and Vision statements.
       b) The HEI’s Values, and how they are ‘lived’.
        c) Aims and Goals of the HEI (broadly, what the HEI aims to achieve).
       d)  Objectives (a more specific definition of intended achievements).
       e) Key Performance Indicators and Targets (a measurable expression of objectives).
           f)  Policies, procedures and by-laws (rules by which the HEI operates).
       g) The HEI’s plans (identifying objectives).
       h) The HEI’s organisational structure (including the committee structure).

      The approach, or statements of intent, are found in a variety of sources and care should be
       taken that they are consistent and do not conflict with each other. Typical sources include:

       a) The HEI’s Strategic Plan and Operational Plans.
       b) Key institutional documents such as manuals, handbooks and guidelines.
        c) The HEI’s Website, Prospectus and/or Catalogue.
       d) Budgets detailing the allocation of resources.
       e) Minutes of committees or decision-making groups.
           f)  Job descriptions and terms of reference.
       g)  Directives issued by senior institutional staff entitled to do so.
       h) Less formal correspondence and verbal statements from senior institutional staff.

      The HEI should describe the approach taken for each Criterion, or the approach that  it is
       proposing, as the starting point. The HEI then needs to describe the methods by which these
        intentions are deployed and achieved.

4.2   Deployment

      Statements of intent remain exactly that until they are put into effect. The next step is to
       consider how the approach is deployed. In other words, analysing whether the approach is
       being carried out as expected. This is sometimes also known as implementation, ‘processes’
        or, simply, the ‘do’ part of the ADRI cycle.

      There are several ways in which the HEI can investigate the deployment of an approach.
     One of the most effective is to hold discussions with people, such as interviews, focus groups
       or departmental meetings. The idea is to explore people’s ‘lived experiences’ to see if they
        align with plans, policies and manuals. Another way of investigating deployment is to check
      whether resources are in place as planned and are of appropriate quantity and quality.
      Meeting minutes are a useful means of documenting deployment. Status updates on
        indicators and targets in various plans can also provide evidence of how an approach was
       deployed. The HEI needs to provide the Panel with solid and tangible evidence that an
      approach has been implemented in practice.

4.3    Results

      The assessment of the HEI’s systems against the Criteria cannot be determined by focusing
       only on the goals, plans, inputs and processes. There must be an emphasis on what is
       achieved – that is, on the results. In general, every goal must have a reported result (or
        multiple results) and, vice versa, every result should link back to a goal. It is essential that a

                                              Page 57 of 121

--- Page 61 ---
OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

       causal relationship can be shown between the approach, the deployment and the eventual
        result, otherwise the result may have arisen by chance, rather than being deliberate, with no
       guarantee that the HEI can influence future results and ensure they are sustainable.

       Results may be quantitative, qualitative, or both.  It is not essential that every result be
       numerical, although it is essential that every result be measurable. The HEI needs to ensure
        that an appropriate measure of result has been ascertained for each Criterion. For some
       goals the results presented may be aggregated from the results of component objectives.
       This may involve combining various different types of data. Care must be taken to ensure
        that such results remain valid and reliable. Results are typically documented in reports,
      summaries and presentations, and discussed in meetings.

4.4   Improvement

      Improvement is applicable to all Criteria and all parts of ADRI tend towards improvement.
       Just as there’s no point in having a policy that no staff are aware of or are disregarding,
        equally, there is no point in gathering information about results that is not subsequently used
        to enhance or improve student learning or experience. Improvement requires the HEI to
       provide evidence that processes related to a certain activity are ‘effective’. The way the HEI
      knows whether its approach is effective or not is through review. Without evidence of review,
       the HEI may not know whether it is effective or not. The OAAAQA has defined ‘effective’ as
       ‘successful in producing a deliberate and sustainable result that meets all the requirements
        of the Criteria and Standards’.

     An HEI must reflect on its activities in order to make improvements or enhancements to its
       systems. The ‘improvement’ dimension can be thought of as the quality enhancement aspect
        of ADRI. The fundamental assumption underpinning this dimension of ADRI is that an HEI
       ought to be continually reviewing its activities and looking for ways to be the best it can be.
       Targets should be recalibrated periodically; processes should become more efficient and
      more effective over time; and results should indicate increasing success. This requires a
      comprehensive system of review and action – not just an ad hoc consideration of results. All
       reviews should be documented, and improvements made must be communicated to the
       relevant stakeholders.

5   Types of Evidence and Data Analysis

      The ratings given to Standards and Criteria in the ISA Report are not based on whether the
       evidence  is incontrovertible, but on the professional judgements of peers (ISA Panel
      Members) through careful consideration of all the available evidence presented in the MMs
      and SMs and obtained in interviews. ISA does not assume that there is a single correct way
        in which a system should be implemented or that there is only a single correct interpretation
        of an organisational situation. Instead,  it prompts the Panel to reach evidence-based
       conclusions that are authoritative and support the ratings given to the Standards and Criteria.
      To achieve that goal,  it is helpful to consider the wide range of evidence and tools for
        collecting, analysing and interpreting evidence. This Manual does not intend to be fully
      comprehensive on these topics but presents some guidance for those involved in ISA.

5.1   Using Statistics

     One of the most powerful means for communicating information about the HEI’s performance
         is through the use of statistics. The OAAAQA offers the following advice about presenting
      and interpreting statistics by HEIs in their ISAA:

       a)  Statistical results should be reported against targets to assist with their interpretation.

       b)  Statistics should be presented as trends across five years where possible as trends are
           obviously more reliable than single snapshots of data that may have been influenced by
            outlying, or non-typical, circumstances.
        c) Where possible, ratios or percentages should be used instead of raw numbers as the
             latter are difficult to interpret.
       d) The HEI should be prepared to defend the accuracy, validity and reliability of any statistics
             in the ISAA.

5.2   Date Stamping Evidence

     Many forms of evidence are dynamic in that they may change over time. Point-in-time
      assessment can therefore be challenging because the evidence may change even during
       the course of the ISA Panel’s deliberations, meaning that findings can be disproved. It is
        essential, therefore, that techniques are used for confirming the date (and, sometimes, the
       time) when the evidence was collected. There are several techniques for this collectively
      known as ‘date stamping’.

      The form of evidence most at risk of changing during the ISA is that gathered from websites
      and other online items. If a Panel Member finds a website that is used as reference material
        for a finding in the ISA Report, then this may be saved as a ‘screenshot’ image or similar.
      These electronic file formats should automatically include a date stamp in the document
        footer. It is conventional to refer to ‘date accessed’ for all material referred to on the internet.

       Verbal comments made during interviews are also prone to change or become mistaken
      memories. Accurate and comprehensive notes are therefore taken at the time of the Visit,
       generally by the RD although all Panel Members maintain their own notes and records. The
      HEI has an opportunity to correct (in ISA Report v5) any factual errors that may occur during
        this process.

5.3    Evaluating New Processes

      HEIs ought to be committed to making improvements with or without ISA but inevitably there
         is a human tendency to be more motivated to address problems just before the ISA occurs.
       While the OAAAQA is supportive of an HEI using the ISA to gain additional momentum for
          its improvement efforts, it nonetheless recognises that this may have consequences. One
      such consequence is the temptation by an HEI to present new approaches, systems and
       procedures as standard practice when in fact they have been newly introduced and are yet
        to be tested through time and experience. This practice (commonly referred to as the ‘wet
        paint syndrome’) is problematic as a Panel may regard it as misleading and outside the spirit
        of collaboration that underpins the quality assurance process.

      Where HEIs are transparent about new approaches, systems and procedures, a Panel may
       not reach positive conclusions about deployment or subsequent results, as these may not
       yet have come into effect. Nonetheless, they may be more likely to be highly positive
       regarding approach and improvement. Furthermore, an HEI that acts upon  identified
       opportunities for improvement demonstrates quality management in practice.

      Where the Panel evaluates newly introduced systems or processes that have yet to yield
       deliberate or sustainable results, the related Criterion is likely to be rated Partially Met. This
        rating reflects, in the professional judgement of the Panel, that a new system or process
      appears to be appropriate and capable of achieving the HEI’s intended results at a later date.

6    Assessing the Credibility of Evidence

       Conclusions are not reached based on single items of evidence. Most issues are complex
      and arriving at a defensible conclusion involves comprehensive consideration of the issue.

                                              Page 59 of 121

--- Page 63 ---
OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

     Two strategies for evaluating the reliability and credibility of the evidence presented and
       achieving defensible conclusions are saturation and triangulation.

6.1   Saturation

       Saturation is used to show that an issue is systematic, systemic, or endemic. A staff member
     who expresses satisfaction to the Panel about professional development opportunities at the
       HEI, for example, does not constitute evidence that the majority of staff are satisfied with the
       professional development opportunities available to them. Saturation is a method whereby a
      Panel explores an issue until no new information about it comes to light. During the ISA Visit,
        this is achieved by asking the same (or similar) questions to different groups of people until
      a clear theme emerges from the responses.

            It is not always necessary to obtain saturation of an issue. Sometimes, the mere presence of
      an issue is sufficient.  If an HEI claims, for example, that all classrooms have fixed data
        projectors, but the Panel discovers that one does not, then the HEI’s claim has been
       disproved. To gauge whether the exception is of importance, the Panel is likely to seek as
     much corroborating evidence as possible to have greater confidence in the importance of the
        findings.

6.2   Triangulation

       Triangulation is a method whereby analysis is strengthened using a combination of the
        following:
       a)  Multiple  original sources  of data (such as students,  staff, management, external
           stakeholders, authoritative references and benchmarks).
       b)  Multiple methods of data collection (such as surveys, interviews, observations, internal
         documents, literature and statistics).
        c)  Different types of data (such as objective and subjective).

      By using a combination of the above,  it is generally possible for a Panel to establish the
       appropriateness of a conclusion and any corresponding rating. Evidence that is cited from
       the ISAA alone is likely to be called out during moderation. While the ISAA is an essential
       form of information sharing,  it is not a given that all the information therein is valid. Panel
      Members are therefore required to verify this information through triangulation. Panel
      Members may use the ISAA to some extent at face value, albeit informed by the evidence,
       but they will check that the information is accurate through triangulation during the ISA Visit.

7    Reaching Conclusions

      The Panel must work towards consensus, but not necessarily unanimous agreement, on key
        findings and the Criteria and Standards’ ratings (see Part D). In all cases, decisions regarding
      whether a Criterion has been Met, Partially Met or Not Met must be based on evidence and
      an HEI must ensure evidence is provided to support all claims made in the ISAA. Different
       types of evidence, both objective and subjective in nature, are considered to support
       decisions about ratings. Lack of data forthcoming from the HEI does not necessarily suggest
       incomplete analysis by the Panel.  It is incumbent on a Panel, however, to request any
        additional evidence that is required to arrive at a carefully considered rating. In cases where
       the HEI may be unable or unwilling to provide the type of data needed to demonstrate that
          all requirements of a Criteria have been Met, Panel Members must interpret the lack of
       evidence as they see  fit. When rating each Criterion, a Panel must understand the
        characteristics of provision or practice associated with each rating as the key reference point
        for determining ratings against the Criteria. Once all Criteria have been rated, the Standard
        rating and Accreditation Outcome are automatically calculated.

8     Institutional Standards Ratings

        Institutional Accreditation Outcomes are based on ratings given by the ISA Panel to each of
       the six Standards. Standard ratings, in turn, are based on the ratings given to each Criterion.
     A single rating scale is used by all ISA (and ISR) Panels and for all ISA (and ISR) reviews
      HEIs contribute to the rating process during their self-assessment by self-rating each
        Criterion in the ISAA. Details on the self-assessment and the preparation of the ISAA are
       provided later in this Manual (see Part E). In a multi-campus submission, both the HEI and
       the ISA Panel rate the institution as a single entity, based on a review of the different
      campuses. Separate ratings for each campus are not given. The following sections describe
       the mechanisms used for rating Criteria and Standards and provide an interpretation of the
       possible Institutional Accreditation Outcomes.

8.1    Criteria Ratings

      Both the HEI and the ISA Panel are required to rate every Criterion using the same rating
        scale. As part of the self-assessment, the HEI is encouraged to assess itself critically against
          all Criteria in its ISAA. The ISA Panel rates the HEI after the on-site ISA Visit based on the
       evidence collected against the requirements set out in the ISA Criteria (see Part B). The
        Criteria  ratings  in  turn determine  the Standard  ratings and the  overall  Institutional
       Accreditation Outcome. Table 5 shows the rating scale used to assess performance against
      a Criterion.

                        Table 5: Criterion Ratings

                                      Description                                   Rating

         • Provision or practice consistently meets all the applicable requirements of the
            Criterion most of the time*.
         • Results against the Criterion are achieved through a deliberate approach and       Met
          are sustainable.
         • Performance is satisfactory.

         • Provision or practice does not consistently meet all the applicable requirements
            of the Criterion most of the time.
         • The HEI has  failed to demonstrate  its  ability to meet  all the applicable     Not Met
          requirements of the Criterion.
         • Performance is unsatisfactory.

         • Provision or practice does not meet all the applicable requirements of the
            Criterion most of the time, but the HEI has demonstrated an appropriate
         commitment  to and  capacity  for  ensuring   it meets  all  the  applicable
                                                                                                Partially Met
          requirements of the Criterion within one year.
         • Performance  is expected to be satisfactory within one year and  for the
          remainder of the accreditation cycle.

           * Meeting the requirements of the Criterion most of the time does not mean meeting the requirements in most
           of the departments of a college or meeting them in most colleges of a university (and so forth). It means that the
         requirements are met consistently and systematically over time, except in some instances due to extenuating
          circumstances.

     A Met rating means that all the applicable requirements of the Criterion are being met most
        of the time. Overall, results are deliberate in that they have been planned and executed as
       planned, and sustainable in that the performance levels are likely to be maintained for the
       duration of the accreditation period. A rating of Met is indicative of practice that meets
        international norms and expectations.

            If an HEI has not met all the requirements of the Criterion most of the time, and performance
         is unsatisfactory, a Not Met rating is awarded for the Criterion. There is insufficient or

                                              Page 62 of 121

Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

       inadequate evidence to demonstrate that the HEI has the ability and the deliberate and
       sustainable systems in place to meet the applicable requirements of the Criterion.

      However, if the HEI can demonstrate a material commitment and capacity to fully meet all
       the Criterion requirements within one year of the Institutional Accreditation Outcome, the Not
      Met rating may be revised to a Partially Met rating for the Criterion. Stating that the HEI
        ‘plans’ or ‘intends’ to address requirements that it has not met, is not sufficient; for a rating of
        Partially Met to be given, the HEI must provide evidence and give the ISA Panel confidence
        that it has most of the requirements in place (for example, policies and successful deployment
        of the approach) but the HEI still needs well-defined time or effort (for example, to review
        findings from deployment and act on them) to ensure the effectiveness of its systems. The
        Partially Met rating allows the Panel to positively acknowledge the efforts made by the HEI
        to identify and address opportunities for improvement.

8.2   Standards Ratings

        Criteria ratings determine the overall Standard rating. The Standard ratings are aligned with
        Criteria ratings. Therefore, a Standard can be rated only as Met or Not Met. There is no
        Partially Met rating for Standards. In order for a Standard to be rated Met, no more than two
        of the Criteria are rated Partially Met, and none of the Criteria is rated Not Met. A Met
      Standard rating means that the HEI meets the requirements of all the Criteria in the Standard,
       or meets all the Criteria except for up to two Criteria, which are deemed to be Partially Met,
       with clear evidence that the HEI demonstrates commitment to meeting these Criteria within
      one year. If more than two Criteria in the Standard are rated Partially Met, or one or more
        Criteria are rated Not Met, then the Standard is rated as Not Met. Table 6 shows the Standard
        ratings and descriptors.

                        Table 6: Standard Ratings

                                       Description                                   Rating
      No more than two Criteria are rated Partially Met, and no Criterion is rated
       Not Met.
                                                                            Met
       The HEI either meets the requirements of all the Criteria within the Standard, or
       meets all the Criteria except for up to two Criteria which are Partially Met.
       More than two Criteria are rated Partially Met or one Criterion or more is
        rated Not Met.
                                                                             Not Met
       The HEI does not meet the requirements of one or more of the Criteria within the
        Standard and/or partially meets more than two Criteria.

8.3    Institutional Accreditation Outcomes

      Standard ratings determine the Institutional Accreditation Outcome. All Standards must be
       rated Met in order for the HEI to be Accredited. An HEI is given a Conditionally Accredited
      outcome if only one Standard is rated Not Met. If two or more Standards are rated Not Met,
       the HEI is placed On Probation. HEIs which are Conditionally Accredited or On Probation are
       required to undergo ISR (see Section 1.2). If after the second ISR attempt, the HEI still does
       not meet all of the Standards, the Institutional Accreditation process is terminated, and the
      HEI is given the status of Not Accredited. Table 7 shows the Institutional Accreditation
      Outcomes.

                                                                                Accredited
       The HEI meets all the national Institutional Standards.

      One Standard is rated Not Met
       The HEI does not meet one  of the  national  Institutional
                                                                               Conditionally Accredited
        Standards. The HEI undergoes ISR after a defined period of
         Conditional Accreditation of up to one year.

      Two or more Standards are rated Not Met
       The HEI does not meet two or more of the national Institutional
                                                        On Probation
        Standards. The HEI undergoes ISR after a defined period On
         Probation of up to one year.

      One or more Standards are rated Not Met following ISR
       The HEI has failed to demonstrate that  it meets the national
           Institutional Standards. The HEI has already completed one or
                                                                       Not Accredited
       more periods of Conditional Accreditation and/or On Probation
       and undergone Institutional Standards Reassessment at least
        once.

8.4   Communication of Accreditation Outcome

      The Accreditation Outcome is published on the OAAAQA website together with the ratings
        for all Standards and all Criteria. The HEI’s supervising Ministry or entity may be notified
      (where applicable) of the final outcome and the final ISA (or ISR) report is sent to the Cabinet.

8.5   ISR Deadline

      HEIs which are Conditionally Accredited or On Probation must undergo ISR. The length of
       time given to the HEI to prepare for the ISR depends on the number of Standards that are
       rated Not Met and the amount of time that the ISA Panel considers is required for the HEI to
      meet the Standards. It must not exceed one year after the Institutional Accreditation Outcome
      has been endorsed by the OAAAQA Board. The deadline for submitting an ISR Application
         is approved by the OAAAQA CEO and endorsed by the OAAAQA Board. If, after ISR, one
       or more Standards have again not been Met but good progress has been made, the HEI is
       given an additional period of up to one year to undergo a second ISR. However, if insufficient
       progress has been shown after the first ISR, the OAAAQA reserves the right to terminate the
       ISA, give the HEI Not Accredited status, and advise the Cabinet and the HEI’s supervising
        Ministry or entity  (if applicable). While the same ISA Standards, Criteria and activities
       described in this Manual apply to the ISR, additional information about the ISR is available
      on the OAAAQA website.

9   The Self-Assessment

      The ISA begins with the HEI conducting a self-assessment of its performance against the
       national institutional Standards. The outcome of the self-assessment is presented in the form
        of the ISA Application (ISAA) which is submitted to the OAAAQA. The submission of the ISAA
        triggers the formal commencement of the 28-week ISA process (see Table 3). The following
       sections provide guidance to the HEI on how to undertake a self-assessment and detail the
      ISAA submission requirements.

9.1   Self-Assessment Principles

       Self-assessment is the process of reviewing the quality of one’s own performance and
       provision against an established set of standards. In the context of higher education quality,
       the term is often used interchangeably with ‘self-evaluation’ and ‘self-study’. Self-assessment
         is based on the principle that the primary responsibility for the management of academic
       standards and quality rests with the HEI, and with the HEI’s staff within their academic units
      and support services. In order to meet that primary responsibility, HEI staff must understand
       the concept  of  self-assessment and be  able  to undertake  self-assessment  activity
        successfully. It is expected that the HEI’s self-assessment and the production of the ISAA
       are undertaken primarily by a dedicated team led by the quality assurance unit and
       comprising key members of the HEI’s staff.

       Self-assessment involves the use of qualitative and quantitative evidence, the analysis of
        that evidence, and the evaluation of the institution arising from that analysis. HEIs are
      encouraged to use ADRI in the self-assessment (see Part C) and are expected to provide
       evidence to show the effectiveness of the systems that are in place to ensure that the national
        institutional Standards are met. Results are important in evaluating whether a Standard has
      been Met or Not Met and must be the result of deliberate plans or actions; equally, the
       presentation of evidence of the sustainability of the system underpinning the results is critical
        to the process. The sustainability of the system is demonstrated through a review of the
        results and the subsequent improvements to the system.

9.2   Development of the ISAA through Self-Assessment

      There are many ways in which an HEI may manage the self-assessment to prepare the ISAA.
      The OAAAQA does not dictate a specific approach. However, the HEI must recognise that
       self-assessment is a comprehensive process that requires considerable time and resources.
            It may be helpful to think about the self-assessment as the ‘process’ and the ISAA as the
        ‘product’. Relevant to both process and product is the gathering and use of evidence, and it
         is expected that both the self-assessment and the ISAA are evidence-based to clearly
      demonstrate how the requirements of each Criterion are met. A significant amount of time
       during the self-assessment is spent on gathering, documenting and labelling evidence, in
       addition to writing up the findings for each Criterion. To do this effectively and efficiently, the
      HEI should adopt a project management approach which ensures that the ISAA is thorough
      and completed on time.

      HEIs may find the following guidelines useful as  it undertakes the self-assessment and
       prepares the ISAA. These guidelines constitute advice only, and HEIs may choose to follow
     some of  it or a different project management approach altogether. The guidelines are
       organised according to the stages of the self-assessment process.

9.2.1  Stage 1: Creating the Self-Assessment Team and Schedule

       a)  Establish a project or steering group (the ‘Self-Assessment Team’) to manage the
         development of the ISAA, or utilise an existing group, such as the institutional quality
          committee. The size of the team may vary; however, at least two team members may be

                                              Page 66 of 121

--- Page 70 ---
Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

           allocated responsibility  for each Standard. The Self-Assessment Team should not
          operate in a vacuum but should draw on the assistance of other staff where appropriate.
                 It is important, therefore, to communicate information about the Team and its purpose to
           the whole HEI community.
       b) While preparing the ISAA should involve staff members with the appropriate knowledge
         and expertise to carry out the task, it should not become the exclusive responsibility of
           only one or two individuals. Although tempting, the relegation of responsibility for the
           preparation of the ISAA only to the quality assurance unit, or to an external consultant, is
             likely to be unsustainable given the comprehensive and diverse nature of the Standards
         and Criteria. More importantly, it is likely to be a less accurate depiction of the institution’s
          performance than a self-assessment carried out by a diverse team of staff. Furthermore,
          assigning responsibility for the ISAA to the quality assurance unit may hinder capacity
           building within the HEI by limiting the opportunities of other HEI staff to learn about the
         ISA process and master the skills needed to conduct a reflective self-assessment.
        c)  Ensure senior leadership of the self-assessment. The process should be championed by
           the very highest levels of the HEI, and a senior leader should chair the Self-Assessment
        Team and oversee the development of the ISAA.
       d)  Allocate the project into manageable tasks to members of the Self-Assessment Team (or
          form smaller working groups) and make it clear from the outset who is responsible for
           gathering evidence for each Criterion and Standard, and who is responsible for collating
         and drafting the ISAA. The Team members who will draft the ISAA are responsible for
           bringing all the sections together into a coherent Application and ensuring consistency in
             style, tone and presentation. Therefore,  it is important to select individuals with good
            writing, editing and formatting skills for this task.
       e) Plan for the extra workload on the staff developing the ISAA and give them the necessary
          resources (time, information and authority) to undertake their tasks effectively.
           f)  Ensure that all the members of the Self-Assessment Team are familiar with this Manual
         and related documents, including the ISAA template.
       g) Determine the timeframe for the development of the ISAA; working back from the
          confirmed ISAA submission date, allow adequate time for drafting and consultation, and
           set milestone dates from the outset. Allow at least six months to complete the self-
         assessment activity.
       h) Assign one Team member to monitor the schedule as the self-assessment progresses,
            to ensure that the deadlines are met and the milestones are reached.
            i)  Prepare a Team meeting schedule to enable regular communication and manage risks
           or issues if they should arise.

9.2.2  Stage 2: Undertaking the Self-Assessment

       a)  Train all the staff involved in ISA in an appropriate assessment method. The OAAAQA
          supports ADRI as a tool for analysis and encourages HEIs to adopt the same approach
          (see Part C).
       b) Be thorough. There is a large amount of information to be collected, analysed, interpreted
         and reported in order to have an effective evidence-based approach to self-rating each
            Criterion.
        c)  Apply the ADRI method when collecting evidence to support the self-rating of each
            Criterion. Evidence is needed to demonstrate the HEI’s approach in a specific area, as
           well as how that approach  is deployed in practice. Evidence of the results of the
          deployment should be collected, in addition to evidence of improvements that have been
        made in the area in recent years, including reviews of systems, processes and practices.
       d) Examine the Indicators provided under each Criterion to develop a clear understanding
            of what is expected in terms of evidence.
       e)  Collect a range of different evidence related to the requirements of each Criterion. Utilise
            existing internal reference points, such as the HEI’s previous ISA Report (and any ISR
           Reports), internal quality or other reports, plans, survey results, forms, meeting minutes,

                                              Page 67 of 121

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

         samples of student work, etc. Be mindful of the evidence limit that is imposed (see Section
            9.4).
           f)  Be selective about the evidence that is submitted with the ISAA. It should be appropriate
            to the requirements of the Criterion, valid, recent and reliable. Submitting lots of evidence
         does not necessarily result in a successful outcome. Avoid making impressive claims
          which usually require impressive evidence.
       g) Document and label (number) every piece of evidence and maintain a single register of
               all evidence referenced in the ISAA. Two types of evidence are expected: Mandatory
           Materials (MMs), which must be provided with the ISAA and are indicated under each
            Criterion in the ISAA template, and Supplementary Materials (SMs), which are at the
           discretion of the HEI but must be relevant. More information about MMs and SMs can be
          found in Section 9.4.
       h)  Monitor and ‘cleanse’ the evidence list to ensure that there are no duplicates (a piece of
          evidence submitted more than once under different labels/numbers) and that all the
          evidence is relevant. Since there is a limit on evidence (MMs and SMs) that can be
          submitted with the ISAA, it is critical to ensure that only relevant evidence is submitted
         and only once.
            i)  Consult a range of internal (e.g., academic staff, support services and administrative staff,
           students) and external (e.g., employers, alumni, partners) stakeholders throughout the
          self-assessment process, depending on the requirements of a Criterion. This involvement
          helps develop a sense of ownership of the ISAA that ensures a more accurate reflection
            of the staff and student experience.
            j)  Keep records and notes of information and evidence related to each Criterion and
          Standard to facilitate the collation and preparation of the ISAA.

9.2.3  Stage 3: Preparing the ISA Application

       a)  Write up the findings and outcomes of the self-assessment in a draft ISAA, with Team
        members submitting their individual sections to the individual(s) responsible for drafting
           the ISAA. The write-up of each Criterion should follow the ADRI format and begin with a
           description of the HEI’s approach, followed by a description of how the approach is
          deployed, an analysis of the results or outcomes of the deployment, and finally an account
            of the improvements that were made to the system, process or practice based on the
            results.
       b) Ensure that every Criterion and Standard is given a self-rating (see Part E). The self-
            rating must be justified in the commentary (which is limited to 500 words per Criterion)
         and MMs and SMs should be provided as evidence to support the justification. The
         commentary for each Criterion should be evaluative and not just descriptive, and clearly
          demonstrate that results are deliberate and sustainable.
        c) The Self-Assessment Team should review the draft ISAA and identify opportunities for
          improvement, including any gaps in the write up of the ADRI method, any missing
          evidence, and any contradictions between Criteria. The latter is of particular importance
         because of the range of individuals involved in the self-assessment and the preparation
            of the ISAA.
       d)  Circulate the ISAA drafts to other relevant stakeholders who are not on the Self-
         Assessment Team for their objective and independent feedback and comments to ensure
            that it is an honest and accurate reflection of how the HEI is performing.
       e) Have a clear procedure for responding to feedback on the draft ISAA from the Self-
         Assessment Team and other stakeholders.
           f)  Check the ISAA, MMs and SMs carefully for plagiarism. Any plagiarism detected by the
       OAAAQA in the submission results automatically in the HEI being placed On Probation.
         Any attempt deemed deliberate to defraud the process may result in the ISA being
           terminated. More information can be found in the OAAAQA Policy on Academic Integrity
             in External Quality Assurance Submissions and Other Related Documents.
       g) Once the ISAA content has been finalised, ensure that it is professionally edited to a high
          standard and checked for spelling and typing errors. It should be noted, however, that

                                              Page 68 of 121

--- Page 72 ---
Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

          outsourcing the writing of the ISAA is inadvisable as it is no substitute (nor guarantee of
         outcome) for generating this important document internally. A final verification of all the
          evidence should also be undertaken at this stage. All the MMs and SMs submitted must
         be referenced in the ISAA.
       h)  Approval from the governing body should be sought before the ISAA is submitted to the
       OAAAQA by the agreed deadline.

9.3   The ISA Application Template

      The ISAA template can be downloaded from the OAAAQA website. The template specifies
       the format and word limits required, along with the list of Mandatory Materials to be submitted
      as evidence. It consists of ten sections. Eight of the ten sections must be completed and
       submitted by the HEI, while two sections (Sections 1 and 4) have been included for
       information purposes. A description of and the requirements for completing each section are
       detailed below. The ISAA should be written in the main language of instruction at the HEI
      and must be professionally edited and presented. This reduces any misunderstandings or
        potential problems that may arise and ensure that the information in the ISAA is accurate,
       consistent and understandable.

9.3.1  Section 1: Overview of the ISA Process

       This section provides a brief overview of the ISA process. It is included in the ISAA template
        for information purposes only.

9.3.2  Section 2: HEI Declaration and Designated Contact Person

       This section contains the declaration by the HEI which must be signed by the HEI’s most
       senior representative. The declaration states that the information contained in the ISAA is
      complete and accurate and the that HEI adheres to all applicable laws and regulations. The
      HEI also declares that the preparation of the ISAA conformed to all protocols set out in this
      Manual and that  it was produced through a process of self-assessment using ADRI or a
        similar method. Finally, the declaration states that the ISAA and all evidence submitted is
        free of plagiarism.

      The HEI’s representative must also nominate a designated Contact Person for the ISA. The
       Contact Person liaises with the Review Director (RD) appointed by the OAAAQA on all
       matters related to the ISA. These two individuals form a single communication channel
      between the HEI and the OAAAQA. No other staff members from the HEI should be included
      on any correspondence between the Contact Person and the RD. This ‘single point of
        contact’ approach simplifies and speeds up communication and co-ordination processes and
      reduces the risks of miscommunication.

      The designated Contact Person needs to be someone with sufficient seniority at the HEI to
        direct and co-ordinate the ISA process. A head or senior member of the quality assurance
        unit (or similar) would be a suitable person to act as the Contact Person but it should not be
       the HEI’s most senior academic post holder (such as the Vice-Chancellor or Dean) due to
       the demanding nature of their role at the HEI.

     No communication about the ISA is permitted between the HEI (including its governing body,
         staff, students or external stakeholders) and any member of the ISA Panel or the OAAAQA
      Board  until the ISA  is completed. The only exceptions  to  this  rule  relate  to formal
      communications between the Chairperson of the HEI and the Chairperson of the OAAAQA
      Board or the OAAAQA Chief Executive Officer. Even these communications should be limited
        to matters of protocol or in the event of a serious complaint by the HEI over the conduct of
       the ISA (see Section 19.1).

9.3.3  Section 3: List of Abbreviations

        In this section, HEIs provide a list of abbreviations used in the ISAA and indicate what they
       stand for. A sample of key abbreviations typically used in ISAAs has been provided in the
       template. An HEI may use all or some of these sample abbreviations or delete and modify
      them as appropriate. Additional abbreviations unique to the HEI should be added and the
         final list should be sorted into alphabetical order. HEIs must verify that all the abbreviations
      used in the ISAA are included in the list in this section of the Application (Section 3).

9.3.4  Section 4: Glossary of Terms

       This section contains a glossary of the terms that are mentioned in the ISAA template. The
      HEI must also use the same terms in its ISAA commentary under each Criterion wherever
       possible to avoid misunderstandings. If the HEI uses terms other than those specified in the
       glossary to refer to a specific concept, this should be clearly explained in the relevant section
        of the commentary under the Criterion (or Criteria). The existing glossary should not be
       modified by the HEI, however, where required, the HEI may include additional terms in the
       glossary which are commonly used at the institution.

9.3.5  Section 5: Overview of the HEI

       This section consists of a table which the HEI completes by providing the required
        information. All the information should be current as of the date of the ISAA submission. The
      purpose of this information  is to give the Panel an introductory overview of the HEI,
       contextualise the HEI and its operations, and provide key institutional data which informs the
       external assessment. The use of a single table for this purpose also standardises the data
       reported by every HEI and ensures that  it is complete, reducing the need for the HEI to
       provide additional information prior to and during the ISA Visit. The information presented in
        this Section is not assessed or rated but may be used by the ISA Panel to inform the ratings
        of specific Criteria where applicable.

      The table consists of the following parts: HEI name and contact information; HEI profile;
      academic programmes; academic provision; students and graduates; staff (academic and
       non-academic); and resources and facilities (library and learning resources, information and
       educational technology resources, teaching and other facilities). HEIs should refer to the
       glossary provided in Section 4 of the ISAA when completing the table.

9.3.6  Section 6: HEI Background Information

       This section allows the HEI to provide the Panel with any other relevant information about its
       operations which has not been covered in Section 5. This includes any relevant historical
       information about the HEI which the Panel should be aware of (e.g., mergers with other HEIs
       or closures of campuses). Any current circumstances that require the Panel’s attention
       should also be included (e.g., building a new campus in another location), as well as any
        future goals and plans relevant to the ISA (e.g., new affiliates). HEIs may also use this section
        to detail any special characteristics about their institution or student body. Section 6 should
       not be used to provide a general description of the HEI since this information has already
      been provided in the previous section (Section 5) through key institutional data. The word
         limit for the text in this section is 500 words.

9.3.7  Section 7: Self-Assessment against Standards 1 to 6

       This section constitutes the main part of the ISAA. The HEI is required to rate its own
      performance against each of the Standards and Criteria using the rating scales presented in
       Table 5 and Table 6, and provide a commentary under each Criterion to justify the self-rating,
      and explain how the HEI meets the requirements of the Criterion using the ADRI (or similar)

                                              Page 70 of 121

      method of analysis. A commentary for the Standard rating is not required. The Criterion
      commentary is limited to 500 words and should be succinct, relevant and focused on the
       evaluation of the outcomes, instead of descriptions of processes. There should be no
       duplicate commentary across different Criteria, and, where necessary, cross-referencing
       should be used instead. The commentary should include references to relevant evidence
     (MMs and SMs) to justify how the Criterion requirements are being met. For more information
       about the evidence expected to be submitted with the ISAA, please refer to Section 9.4. The
      ISAA may also make good use of diagrams, tables, figures and charts in the commentary to
       display evidence visually where this would be beneficial to the Panel’s understanding.

9.3.8  Section 8: List of All Mandatory Materials Submitted

       This section contains a checklist of  all the Mandatory Materials (MMs) which must be
       submitted with the ISAA as evidence. The checklist should be used by the HEI to verify and
       confirm that all the MMs have been submitted.

9.3.9  Section 9: List of All Supplementary Materials Submitted

       This section includes a table in which the HEI should list all the Supplementary Materials
      (SMs) that have been submitted with the ISAA. The SMs should be listed in the order in which
       they appear in the ISAA commentary. The HEI may add as many more rows to the table as
       required. The total number of Supplementary Materials must not exceed 450.

9.3.10 Section 10: Institutional Data

       This section requires the HEI to provide three types of longitudinal institutional data which
       are relevant to the ISA review. These include student enrolment data, academic staff data,
      and non-academic staff data for the current academic year and the previous five academic
       years. The data presented in Section 10 for the current academic year must be consistent
       with the data presented in Section 5 of the ISAA.

9.4   ISAA Evidence

         All ISAAs must be supported with evidence which is to be submitted concurrently with the
        Application. The evidence presented by the HEI must clearly demonstrate to the ISA Panel
     how the institution meets the requirements of a Criterion. The ISA Panel uses the evidence
       submitted to verify claims made in the ISAA commentary, facilitate their (the Panel’s)
       understanding of the HEI, and ensure that established and well-understood systems,
      processes and practices are in place at the HEI. There are two types of evidence to be
       provided: Mandatory Materials (MMs) and Supplementary Materials (SMs) as shown in
       Figure 3. They are described in more detail in subsequent sections.

                 Mandatory Materials        Supplementary Materials        Additional Supplementary
                                                                                                    Materials

                                                                               Supplementary Materials                      250 Mandatory Materials                Up to 450

                                                                          by the ISA Panel prior to,                   which must be submitted with             selected by the HEI and
                                                                                      during and at the end of                                the ISAA                   submitted with the ISAA

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

      Evidence can take different forms and formats. Most evidence is made up of documents such
      as policies and procedures, manuals, plans, reports, surveys, samples of student work,
       forms, meeting minutes and other  institutional documents. Evidence can also include
      photographs or videos, where applicable. In all cases, the HEI should submit the most recent
       evidence available, unless a specific timeframe is indicated in the MMs or by the Panel. It is
       also important to include evidence of an approach that has been put into practice. For
      example, the Panel expects to see completed forms rather than empty templates; survey
        result summaries or reports rather than blank surveys; and action plans with actual deadlines,
        responsibilities and status updates on actions taken. Finally, the Panel expects to receive
       actual institutional documents and information which already exists in the HEI, rather than
       evidence that has been developed specifically for the purpose of the ISA. The only exception
         is if the Panel requests particular information in a certain format (e.g., a summary) which the
      HEI does not typically employ or maintain. In this instance, the HEI may prepare the
       information and submit it as evidence, clearly indicating that it was generated at the Panel’s
       request.

     When deciding which evidence to submit, an HEI should be selective, ensuring that all
       evidence is valid, accurate, relevant to the Criterion, and the claims being made are open to
        triangulation. Submitting too much evidence of an unfocused nature may obscure the
       relevant materials and is likely to over-burden the ISA Panel with documentation that is non-
       productive or not significant. The quality of the evidence is more important than the quantity
        of documents submitted. To further reinforce this principle, the ISAA template restricts the
         total evidence which can be provided by the HEI to a maximum of 700. This includes 250
     MMs which must be submitted, leaving the HEI with 450 SMs that can be selected for
        inclusion. The limit placed on the number of MMs and SMs is also intended to discourage
      HEIs from submitting the same evidence multiple times using a different numbering label.
      The OAAAQA may review the evidence limit for multiple-campus HEIs.

         All evidence must be referenced in the Criteria commentaries in parentheses (e.g. (MM24)
       or (SM8)) and hyperlinked to the original electronic file. The Panel should be able to click on
      an MM or SM referenced in a particular Criterion commentary and view the evidence.
      Evidence which contains  confidential or personal information  (e.g.,  staff performance
       appraisals, disciplinary outcomes, student records, or similar) can be anonymised. Any MMs
       or SMs which cannot be accessed or opened due to technical issues with the file are
       disregarded by the Panel. Therefore, it is important that the HEI verifies the ease of access
        to every MM and SM prior to the ISAA submission. At the same time, the HEI should verify
        that all the MMs and SMs submitted have been referenced in the ISAA commentary. It is not
       the responsibility of the Panel to determine which Criterion an MM or SM refers to  if  it is
       submitted with the ISAA but not referenced in the commentary.

      The HEI is responsible for ensuring that all evidence is made available in the language of the
      ISA wherever possible. Where this is not possible, a brief synopsis of the content should be
       given in the language of the ISA. An HEI should be aware that it is neither the responsibility
        of OAAAQA to provide translation services for any ISAA submission, nor the role of bi-lingual
      ISA Panel Members to spend time translating MMs or SMs for their fellow reviewers.

9.4.1  Mandatory Materials (MMs)

      Mandatory Materials (MMs) are materials (evidence) which must be provided by the HEI and
      presented in a format of  its choosing (e.g. as text or in tables) provided the required
       information is submitted. A number of MMs has been specified in the ISAA template under
      each Criterion, and the full list is available in Section 8 of the ISAA. It is important to note,
      however, that only submitting the required MMs is not sufficient to demonstrate that the
        Criterion requirements have been Met. While MMs constitute mandatory evidence to be
       submitted, they must be supplemented with Supplementary Materials (see Section 9.4.2).

                                              Page 72 of 121

Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

      Every MM is numbered and indexed (MM1 to MM250) and includes a clear description of
      what must be provided. Generally, HEIs must submit data indicated in an MM for a period of
        five years which represents the timeframe between the current and previous accreditations.
            If data for five years is not available, the HEI must explain the reasons for this in the ISA
       Application under the affected Criterion. The same MM may be referenced under multiple
        Criteria and can also be referenced by the HEI even if it is not indicated specifically as an
    MM under a Criterion. For example, MM26 and MM33 are relevant to a number of different
        Criteria.

            If an HEI does not have a required MM available, it needs to indicate ‘Not Available’ in the
           list of MMs submitted with the ISAA. A Supplementary Material (SM) may be submitted in lieu
        of the unavailable MM but without a corresponding increase in the permitted SM limit. In other
       words, the MM being replaced by an SM is counted within the imposed SM limit of 450. In
     some cases, an HEI may submit the incorrect information for an MM and if this does occur,
       the correct MM will need to be submitted along with any other additional SMs requested by
       the Panel.

9.4.2  Supplementary Materials (SMs)

        In addition to 250 MMs, HEIs may submit up to 450 Supplementary Materials (SMs) as
        additional evidence to justify claims made in the Criteria commentaries. The SMs chosen for
        this purpose must be relevant and appropriate. The Indicators under each Criterion may be
      used by the HEI as a guide as to what constitutes appropriate supplementary evidence.

            If the Panel is unable to verify a claim through the MMs and SMs submitted with the ISAA, a
       request may be made for additional SMs. These SMs are generally identified during the
       preliminary review of materials by the ISA Panel. A list of these additional SMs is forwarded
        to the HEI prior to the Planning Visit. The additional SMs must then be provided by the HEI
       before the end of the Planning Visit (see Sections 15.4.1 and 15.5). Requests for more
        additional SMs may also be made by the Panel during the ISA Visit. In this instance, the HEI
         is notified at the end of the ISA Visit and given up to seven days after the Visit to supply the
        additional SMs. It is important to note that any additional SMs requested by the Panel at the
      end of the ISA Visit must have existed at the HEI before the last day of the ISA Visit.
      Documents created after the end of the ISA Visit will not be accepted as SMs.

9.4.3  Technical Requirements for Submitting MMs and SMs

      Given the amount of evidence required during an ISA,  it is imperative to maintain a clear
       indexing and numbering system to assist with managing the materials. This should be done
      by the HEI from the outset of the self-assessment. Whenever a piece of evidence is selected
        for inclusion in the ISAA, it should be added to a central register or folder of evidence created
      by the Self-Assessment Team and categorised as an MM or an SM. All evidence must be
        clearly indexed and numbered, and an accurate description of  its content should be
       maintained.

      The indexing convention used by the OAAAQA for numbering MMs and SMs consists of the
       material type (MM or SM) followed by its sequential number. Zeros do not need to be used
        to precede single- and double-digit numbers (e.g., SM1 should be used instead of SM001,
       or SM25 instead of SM025). The numbering of SMs must follow the sequence in which the
     SMs appear in the Criteria commentaries. Every SM must be labelled with a clear and correct
       description of its contents in Section 9 of the ISAA. Incorrectly labelled SMs delay the Panel’s
      assessment of the evidence and create difficulties when referencing these SMs in the ISA
       Report. Examples of clearly indexed and labelled SMs are provided below.

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

     SM1  Minutes of Academic Council Meetings (AY 2020/21 to AY 2022/23)
     SM2  Student Satisfaction Survey Reports (AY 2021/22 and AY 2022/23)
     SM3   List of Newly Appointed Academic Staff in Sept 2023 (Full time and Part time)
     SM4  Photographs of Extracurricular Activities (AY 2022/23)

      Every SM and the majority of MMs must be submitted as a single searchable file. Typical file
       formats include  ‘pdf’ or  ‘doc’, however other  file formats are acceptable  for specific
        information. For example, numerical information may be submitted  in an  ‘xls’  file; a
       presentation may be submitted as a ‘ppt’ file; and images may be submitted as ‘jpg’ files.
      Documents scanned as images cannot be searched and should be avoided. Submitting a
       series of files together in a folder makes it difficult to search for and locate evidence and does
       not allow for accurate referencing to MMs and SMs in the ISA Report text. Therefore, folder
       submissions have been limited to MMs to avoid having a single file consisting of hundreds of
      pages being submitted due to the volume of evidence required. A total of 87 MMs may be
       submitted in folders and these are denoted with an * next to the MM number in Section 8 of
       the ISAA template. Some examples of these are shown in Table 8. An HEI may also submit
       the MMs denoted with an * as a single file if the information is available in a single file. The
      use of sub-folders is not permitted.

       Table 8: Examples of Mandatory Materials Submitted as Folders

      MM #                        MM Description

        MM7*   Governance bodies’ meeting minutes for last five years

         MM28*     Institutional Annual Reports for the last five years

         MM36*    Audited financial statements for the last five years
                 Summary reports of all student and staff surveys conducted for the last two years and samples from the
         MM42*

                     Meeting minutes of all industry advisory boards for the last two years and samples from the previous three
        MM228*
                      years
        MM234*    All current agreements (or equivalent) with local and international education providers

        File names should be kept short to facilitate easy identification and access through secure
          file sharing platforms, which are used to submit the ISAA and all evidence. The HEI’s Contact
      Person and the Panel Support Officer should liaise regarding the appropriate platform to use
        for the ISAA submission. Once the ISAA has been submitted on the due date, it is final and
      no further changes to the Application or evidence can be made. HEIs may not delete or
       modify the files submitted, or add new files to the file sharing platform, except if the Panel
       requests additional SMs before the Planning Visit or at the end of the ISA Visit. The RD
       monitors the date stamps on the file sharing platform to ensure that no changes are made.
        In the case of a multi-campus ISA, the HEI is expected to organise the evidence submitted
        into a single folder for all common MMs and SMs that apply to all campuses (e.g., institutional
       plans and policies), and separate folders for each campus for those MMs and SMs which are
       related only to a particular campus. The campus folders should be clearly labelled with the
     name of the campus and the contents (MMs or SMs). For example, if an HEI has campuses
        in Muscat and Sohar, the respective folders must be labelled as follows: ‘MUSCAT MMs’;
     ‘MUSCAT SMs’; ‘SOHAR MMs’; and ‘SOHAR SMs’.

9.5   Good Practice

       At the end of each Standard in the ISAA template, HEIs are given the opportunity to nominate
      one area of good practice at their institution related to any Criterion in that Standard. This

                                              Page 74 of 121

--- Page 78 ---
Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

       nomination is optional and does not impact the ratings or Institutional Accreditation Outcome.
      The Panel only rates Criteria based on the commentary provided and related evidence. HEIs
       should not assume that making a good practice nomination in each Standard leads to a more
       favourable Accreditation outcome,  or  vice versa. The purpose  of the good  practice
       nomination is to support the creation of a national higher education good practice database
      which will allow HEIs to share and learn from high quality practices at their peer institutions.

      The Glossary in Section 4 of the ISAA template provides a definition of good practices as
        ‘deliberate and systematic  institutional  practices and/or processes which  consistently
      produce quality outcomes over an extended period, and which are potentially useful for other
       HEIs’. Therefore, the practice should have been in place at the HEI for a number of years
       during which it should have consistently produced quality outcomes. MMs or SMs referenced
        in the ISAA must be used as evidence to support claims made about the good practice.
       Additional evidence which  is not referenced in any Criteria commentaries may not be
       submitted for a good practice nomination. The Panel verifies the nomination by reviewing the
       evidence already submitted, and, based on its expertise, makes a recommendation for
        inclusion in the national database if warranted.

9.6    Preparing for the ISAA Submission and Completeness Checklist

      The submission of the ISAA involves a final check by the Self-Assessment Team to ensure
             it is  fit for purpose and of an appropriate standard expected from HEIs. This final check
       involves a ‘read through’ during which questions presented in Table 9 should be addressed.

                Table 9: Final ISA Application Read Through

           No.                                         Question

           1     Does the ISAA meet the needs of its primary readership, namely the ISA Panel?
                Does the ISAA clearly demonstrate (through commentary and evidence) that the HEI meets the
           2                         Institutional Standards and Criteria?
                         Is the ISAA self-evaluative/reflective, based on evidence, and demonstrative of the use of ADRI or           3
                 a similar method of analysis?
                Does the ISAA contain a helpful balance of description and analysis (results and their
           4
                       interpretation; since evaluation and analysis should generally outweigh description of processes)?
                         Is the ISAA a transparent and honest account of the strengths and limitations of the HEI and its
           5                    plans for improvement?
                Does the ISAA avoid being ‘promotional’ and using language more appropriate to a prospectus or a           6
                    marketing tool?
            7       Is the ISAA clearly written, using unambiguous language and consistent terminology throughout?

     Once the final read-through and check is complete, the ISAA and all the evidence (MMs and
      SMs) must be submitted to the OAAAQA by 11:30 A.M. on the due date agreed with the HEI.
      The submission should be made electronically by the designated Contact Person using the
      agreed file sharing platform. The HEI must also check that access to the ISAA and evidence
         is not hindered by any internal firewall protection or security protocols which make them
       inaccessible to external parties.

     Upon receiving the ISAA, the Review Director carries out a Completeness Check (see
       Section 15.1) to verify that the submission is complete, and no information or evidence is
       missing.  If any items remain outstanding after the Completeness Check, then the HEI is
      expected to make these available in a timely manner before the ISA commences. To pre-
      empt any delays, a checklist is provided in Appendix B to assist the HEI with ensuring its
      ISAA passes the Completeness Check prior to making the submission. The HEI is expected

        to provide a signed copy of the checklist with its submission, clearly indicating that all the
       required sections have been submitted by ticking the checkboxes.

9.7   Fees

      The OAAAQA operates on a cost recovery basis. The Financial Law permits OAAAQA to
       determine fees for activities conducted in the performance of its functions, subject to Ministry
        of Finance’s approval. The OAAAQA Policy on Fees Charged for OAAAQA External Quality
      Assurance Activities and Appeals provides details of the current fees levied by OAAAQA.
      The HEI is issued with an invoice ahead of the scheduled submission date and must transfer
       the full fees to the OAAAQA. Upon receipt of the fee payment the OAAAQA issues a receipt.
      The OAAAQA normally expects fees to be paid in full no later than 30 days after the invoice
      has been issued and before the commencement of ISA. The fee for ISA is not inclusive of
      ISR activities.

 ASSESSMENT BY THE ISA PANEL

10   External Assessment Protocols

      The self-assessment and submission of the ISAA is followed by an external assessment by
      a Panel of peer External Reviewers (ERs). The most visible part of this process is the visit of
       the Panel to the HEI to interview staff and students (the ISA Visit). This  is only one
      component, however, of a comprehensive external assessment. This section provides an
       overview of the key external assessment protocols and procedures that are followed by the
     OAAAQA prior to and during the ISA Visit.

10.1   External Reviewers’ Conflicts of Interest

       External Reviewers and relevant OAAAQA staff must declare any potential conflict of interest
        prior to their participation in an ISA review in line with the OAAAQA Policy on Conflict of
        Interest in External Quality Assurance Activities in Higher Education. This includes personal
      and professional conflicts of interest. Any such conflict of interest may prevent their further
       involvement in the ISA. This is determined by the OAAAQA on a case-by-case basis. The
      HEI is also given the opportunity to inform the OAAAQA if any potential External Reviewers
      have a conflict of interest with the institution.

10.2   External Reviewers’ Contract

         All ERs involved in an ISA must complete the OAAAQA’s Service Provision Contract for
       External Quality Assurance Activities. This contract applies to all roles involved in the ISA,
       including the Panel Chairperson (and Co-Chairperson where applicable), Panel Member,
       External Review Director (and Assistant External Review Director where applicable), and
       Observer. The contract includes (but is not limited to) key details about the ISA and conflict
        of interest statements. It also covers protocols such as confidentiality. All ERs are expected
        to abide by their contractual obligations at all times.

10.3  Undue Influence

            It is unacceptable for an HEI to exert undue influence on the ISA Panel, OAAAQA staff or
     OAAAQA Board in relation to any EQA activity, including ISA. Undue influence by the HEI
        (or stakeholders of the HEI) may take many forms, including (but not limited to) the following:
       a) Communication with individual Panel Members, OAAAQA staff or OAAAQA Board
        members during the ISA that are outside the ISA communication protocols;
       b)  Explicit or implied threats made against the ISA Panel, OAAAQA staff or Board members;
        c)  Explicit or implied promises of benefit to the ISA Panel, OAAAQA staff or Board members;
       d) Any gifts and overly generous hospitality during the ISA Visit.

      Any undue influence during the ISA is reported to the OAAAQA Board. Excessive undue
       influence may require the ISA process to be terminated and the HEI to be placed On
       Probation.

10.4  The Non-Attribution Rule

     When conducting interviews with stakeholders during the ISA Visit, the Panel uses the
       information it receives in subsequent ISA Reports without attributing that information to the
      person who provided it. This principle is known as ‘Chatham House Rules’ and it allows for
      open discussion to take place. The names of interviewees are not mentioned in any ISA
       Report, nor is any other information that could be used to identify a specific interviewee.
        Similarly, the OAAAQA expects that confidentiality and the non-attribution rule be respected
      by all those who participate in the ISA interview process from the HEI’s side. As such,
       interviewees are not permitted to take notes or use any form of recording device in the
       interview sessions. HEIs should also not place interviewees under any pressure to disclose
      any responses that they or other interviewees provided to the ISA Panel.

Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

10.5   Sensitive Information

      The HEI provides the ISA Panel with evidence in the form of MMs and SMs, some of which
     may contain sensitive and commercially confidential information. The OAAAQA Policy on
      Access to HEI Information and Stakeholders applies to all information submitted by the HEI
        for the ISA. This includes information which  is personally, commercially,  militarily or
       governmentally confidential. Panel Members are required to treat the information sensitively
      and in the strictest confidence, as indicated in their contract. Failure to abide by this
        confidentiality requirement will result in the ER being removed from the OAAAQA Register of
       External Reviewers in accordance with the OAAAQA Policy on The Management of The
       National Register of External Reviewers for Higher Education Quality Assurance.

10.6  OAAAQA’s Role in Complaints about the HEI

            It is not the purpose of an ISA to hear and resolve complaints from students, staff or other
       stakeholders about specific issues in relation to the HEI undergoing assessment. The ISA
      Panel is not a court, arbitrator or mediator. It does not have a role in resolving individual
       complaints or problems and does not offer a proposed resolution to specific cases. The Panel
     may use a specific case as one source of evidence when exploring how complaints are
     managed at the HEI but only in the context of exploring systemic problems related to the ISA
      Standards and Criteria.

11   Before the ISAA Submission

       This section outlines the preliminary operational and planning activities undertaken by the
     OAAAQA and the HEI prior to the ISAA submission and the official commencement of the
      ISA process in Week 0 (see Table 3).

11.1  Reconfirming the Scheduled ISAA Submission Date

       At least six months prior to the date by which an HEI is scheduled for an ISAA submission,
       the OAAAQA contacts the HEI in writing to reconfirm the scheduled submission date and to
      check that staff and students are available for interviews during the indicative ISA Visit dates.
      The OAAAQA (usually through the RD) may also contact the HEI to arrange an in person
       meeting, where required, to commence the general arrangements for the ISA.

11.2  Appointing the Review Director

      Each ISA Panel has an RD whose role, as the name implies, is to direct the ISA process and
       support the smooth and effective implementation of ISA. This person is either a member of
       the OAAAQA technical staff or is selected from the OAAAQA National Register of External
      Reviewers and appointed as an External Review Director (ERD). In certain cases (such as
       multi-campus ISAs), there may be a need to appoint Assistant RDs who will have specific
        responsibilities under the direction of the RD. The HEI is provided with the names of the RD
      and any Assistant RDs (where applicable). The OAAAQA implements mechanisms (such as
        training and mentoring), where necessary, to support the role of the RD as guided by the
     OAAAQA Policy on the Management of the National Register of External Reviewers for
       Higher Education Quality Assurance.  It should be noted that being a Panel Member or
       previous RD for an EQA for a given HEI does not preclude the possibility of serving as an
     RD for an EQA of the same HEI in the future.

      The list of tasks that the RD is responsible for carrying out includes (but is not restricted to)
       the following:
       a) To provide direction to the ISA Panel on the process as set out in this Manual and in other
            directives (such as policies and procedures) issued by OAAAQA.
       b) To provide, with other OAAAQA staff, high quality administrative support to the ISA Panel.

        c) To be the primary point of contact between the HEI, the Panel Chairperson and Panel
         Members.
        d) To conduct the Completeness Check of the ISA submission (see Section 15.1) and
           resolve any issues with the HEI prior to the ISA commencement.
        e) To read and be familiar with the contents of the ISAA and evidence submitted by the HEI.
           f)  To maintain up to date records of all evidence submitted with the ISAA.
        g) Based on Panel Members’ contributions, to prepare agendas, worksheets and other
          working documents.
        h) To prepare different versions of the ISA Report based on the text provided by Panel
         Members before the ISA Visit.
             i)  To organise the Preliminary Meeting for the ISA Panel to discuss their initial findings.
            j)  To liaise with the HEI before, during and after the Planning Visit.
        k) Based on Panel Members’ contributions, to produce and edit reports and circulate
           versions to ISA Panel Members for their comments and input after the ISA Visit.
             l)  To liaise with external and internal moderators for the ISA Report and address issues
             identified by the moderators with input from the ISA Panel.
      m) To prepare the final version of the ISA Report for endorsement by the OAAAQA Board.
        n) To prepare a confidential report on the ISA process including an assessment of the
           effectiveness of individual Panel Members.

11.3  Appointing a Contact Person

      As noted previously (see Section 9.3.2), a single communication channel is maintained
      between the OAAAQA and the HEI for the entire duration of the ISA. For the OAAAQA, the
        point of contact is the RD. For the HEI, it is the Contact Person who is nominated in Section
      2 of the ISAA template. Since preliminary contact between the HEI and the OAAAQA also
       takes place prior to the ISAA submission, it is expected that one of the individuals from the
      HEI involved in these preliminary discussions is also nominated as the official Contact Person
         in the ISAA.

12  The ISA Panel

       Every ISA is carried out by a Panel of ERs and steered by an RD who acts as OAAAQA’s
        representative in all matters relating to the ISA. The composition and size of the Panel
      depends on the size of the HEI. A large university is assessed by a bigger Panel compared
        to a small college. This section provides more information about how an ISA Panel is formed,
        with a particular focus on the parts that require HEI engagement in the member selection
       process. The roles and responsibilities of the Panel Members are also described.

            It is important to note that the members of the OAAAQA Board, the OAAAQA CEO and the
     DG CHEQA are not members of any ISA Panel, but all play an important role in overseeing
       the implementation of the ISA process and its overall management and quality assurance.
      The OAAAQA Board has the overall responsibility for Institutional Accreditation and is
       approached to endorse the final ISA Report and Accreditation outcome. The DG’s role
        includes (but is not limited to) intervention in the ISA process to help resolve critical disputes,
      and the CEO’s role includes (but is not limited to) the approval of the Accreditation Outcome.

12.1   Register of External Reviewers

      The ISA Panel is sourced through the OAAAQA’s National Register of External Reviewers.
       This Register includes eminent locally-based and international individuals who have shown
        leadership in their disciplines, in quality assurance, within higher education management or
         in the professions and the relevant industries depending on the nature of each HEI. The
        Register is publicly available on the OAAAQA website. All reviewers listed on the Register
      have undergone a rigorous selection and approval process guided by the OAAAQA Policy

                                              Page 80 of 121

 Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

      on the Management of the National Register of External Reviewers for Higher Education
        Quality Assurance.

       Locally-based ERs are required to complete a formal training programme before their
        inclusion in the Register is confirmed. The training programme is organised and run by the
     OAAAQA. International ERs are sent online training materials by the OAAAQA and requested
        to provide a written statement of their overall understanding of OAAAQA’s EQA activities. It
          is  expected  that  international ERs  will  already have  experience  with  international
        accreditation agencies, as well as the required expertise and skills since they are selected
         for the ER register because of their experience and expertise.

12.2   Identifying the ISA Panel Members

      The OAAAQA assembles an ISA Panel by selecting appropriate experts from the National
        Register of External Reviewers,  all of whom have knowledge and expertise in quality
       assurance  in higher education, experience undertaking  quality reviews  locally and/or
         internationally, and an understanding of the Omani higher education sector and context. The
     OAAAQA reserves the sole right to determine the composition of the ISA Panel and, in each
       case, endeavours to assemble a combination of ERs that  is appropriate for the HEI
       undergoing ISA. All the Panel Members are full members of the team, have the same rights
      and responsibilities, participate equally in all of the ISA activities and attend the ISA Visit. It
       should be noted that being a Panel Member or previous RD for an EQA for a given HEI does
        not preclude the possibility of serving on the Panel of an EQA of the same HEI in the future.

12.3   Forming the ISA Panel

       Forming the ISA Panel involves a two-step process which is described below.

12.3.1 Panel Longlist

      The OAAAQA draws up an initial list of names for each ISA Panel known as the ‘longlist’
        consisting of ERs from the Register with experience and backgrounds appropriate to the HEI
       being assessed. This list must be approved by the DG CHEQA. The approved longlist is then
       submitted in strict confidence to the HEI’s most senior representative who is invited to
      comment on whether any of the longlist candidates present a conflict of interest (see Section
        10.1). While this is the only grounds for objection, an HEI may raise other areas of concern.
      The OAAAQA is not obliged to agree with any objection from the HEI but considers all
        objections carefully.

12.3.2 Panel Shortlist

      The OAAAQA reviews the longlist following the HEI’s response and prepares a shortlist that
          is shared with the RD. The RD checks the availability and willingness of each shortlisted ER
        to participate in the ISA and makes replacements as required until a full Panel is convened.
      Where additional names are required for the longlist, these are also formally approved and
       submitted to the HEI for comment. When the Panel is finalised, the HEI is formally informed
       about the names of the Panel Members, and the ISA Panel is announced on the OAAAQA
        website.

12.4   Size and Composition of the ISA Panel

       For each ISA, the OAAAQA assembles a Panel normally comprised of no less than three
      and up to five ERs from the Register; however, larger Panels may also be formed if required
         particularly in the case of multi-campus ISAs. The size of the Panel is determined by the
     OAAAQA depending on the size of the HEI and the workload involved. A large university with
        multiple campuses and thousands of students requires a Panel that consists of more than

                                              Page 81 of 121

--- Page 85 ---
OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

         five members, while a small college with less than a thousand students can be assessed by
      a Panel of three members. Every Panel has a Chairperson. The composition of the Panel is
       determined by its size, but typically the Panel has a mix of locally-based, regional and
        international reviewers, and members with quality assurance, academic, management and
        industry experience.

12.5   Panel Members’ Code of Conduct

         All ISA Panel Members, including the Chairperson, are ambassadors for the OAAAQA. As
       such, they must abide by the following code of conduct:
        a) Be aware of and uphold the OAAAQA’s Values.
        b)  Act in a positive, ethical, and professional manner, and perform duties to the highest
          standards of honesty and diligence.
        c)  Undertake personally all activities allocated to them as part of the ISA process.
        d)  Refrain from delegating work to anyone else. ISA Panel Members are carefully selected
         based on their experience, expertise, and skills and all Panel Members are approved by
           the OAAAQA CEO prior to their invitation to be involved in an ISA. Any delegation of work
            (including, for example, the downloading of evidence by a personal assistant) constitutes
         a breach of OAAAQA’s protocols and compromises the confidentiality of the process.
        e) Respect the OAAAQA’s protocols and report any breach of protocols to the RD.
           f)  Avoid all direct liaison and communication with the HEI during the ISA, other than during
            interview sessions and the tour of facilities. All other liaison with the HEI is conducted
           through the RD.
        g)  Disclose any uninvited contact with the HEI during the ISA to the RD for appropriate
           consideration and action.
        h)  Maintain positive and constructive relationships with other ISA Panel Members, OAAAQA
              staff and the HEI throughout the ISA.
             i)  Work towards consensus and recognise that ISA Panel Members do not have a power
            of veto over the final Accreditation outcome.
            j)  Adhere to the declaration of confidentiality (as embedded in the OAAAQA Service
           Provision Contract for EQA Activities) which states that ISA Panel Members may not
            publicly disclose any deliberations, discussions or materials pertaining to the ISA.

    Since preserving the integrity of the ISA is of utmost importance, any Panel Members who violate
    the code of conduct above will be removed from the National Register of External Reviewers.

12.5.1 Panel Members’ Companions

      The OAAAQA understands that some ISA Panel Members, and particularly international
      ERs, may wish to bring companions with them during the ISA Visit. The OAAAQA appreciates
         this interest in Oman and the desire to spend some time to enjoy the country. However, Panel
      Members are reminded that during the ISA Visit no external social activities can take place.
         All Panel Members are asked to commit their time and full attention to the ISA throughout the
        duration of the Visit. Panel Members normally have meals together in the evenings, and
       although the setting is social, the meals often involve continuing discussion of matters related
        to the ISA, during which the presence of non-Panel Members would be inappropriate due to
       the confidentiality rule.

12.6   Panel Members’ Roles and Responsibilities

      The following responsibilities are shared by all the members of an ISA Panel:
        a) To complete and return the OAAAQA Service Provision Contract for EQA Activities and
           inform the RD about any matters that are or could be perceived as possible conflicts of
             interest.
        b) To read this Manual thoroughly and apply the process and methods of Standards
          assessment set out in the Manual.

                                              Page 82 of 121

Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

        c) To commit  fully  to the ISA process,  including postponing  all  other  professional
         commitments during the ISA Preliminary Meeting and the ISA Visit.
       d) To complete all assigned tasks in a timely manner and by the agreed deadlines.
       e) To read and evaluate the ISAA and all the evidence and any other materials assigned to
          them.
           f)  To participate actively in all Panel meetings and activities (whether face-to-face or via
         communication technologies) in a spirit of teamwork and collaboration, and undertake
         any consequential responsibilities assigned to ISA Panel Members during meetings.
       g) To participate in the construction of the ISA Visit agenda, develop interview questions,
         and requests for additional SMs.
       h) To participate positively and constructively in the ISA Visit, including in all interview
          sessions and Panel review and discussion sessions.
            i)  To record evidence (e.g., interview notes, notes from reviews of MMs and SMs) and share
                    it with other Panel Members.
            j)  To provide the draft texts for sections of the ISA Report, as assigned to them.
        k) To write up a highly professional report complying with the OAAAQA’s House Style
          Manual.
            l)  To provide detailed and timely commentary on all versions of the ISA Report when
          requested.
      m) To be vigilant in identifying and reporting to the RD any suspected incidences of
           plagiarism, particularly in relation to the primary submission of the ISAA and the evidence.
       n) To comply with the direction of the Chairperson and the guidance on the professional
          process provided by the RD.
       o) To provide feedback to the OAAAQA at the end of the ISA process in the required
           evaluation survey.
       p) To be available to participate in an Appeal interview, if required.

12.6.1 Additional Responsibilities of the Panel Chairperson

        In addition to the responsibilities of Panel Members listed above, the Panel Chairperson has
       the following responsibilities:
       a) To chair all meetings of the ISA Panel, including all interview sessions during the ISA
              Visit. This responsibility may be delegated to another Panel Member if the Panel needs
            to split during the Visit to conduct parallel interviews.
       b)  During the ISA interview sessions, to ensure that no individual dominates the discussions
         and that everyone has an opportunity to be heard.
        c) To ensure that all interview sessions during the ISA Visit begin and end on time as per
           the Visit schedule.
       d) To create a professional, open and positive atmosphere in which critical enquiry, difficult
          decision-making and robust debate may occur without compromising the integrity of the
          process or the participants.
       e) To contribute to the preparation of the Preliminary Meeting Agenda.
           f)  To guide the ISA Panel towards consensus, but not necessarily unanimous agreement,
         on key findings and Standards and Criteria ratings.
       g) To undertake with the RD the Planning Visit and any visits to one or more campus sites
            that may be required. This responsibility may be delegated to another ISA Panel Member,
                    if necessary.
       h) To take the leading role in ensuring all members of the Panel complete their tasks on
          time and to satisfactory standard.

      The responsibilities of any Panel Co-Chairpersons, typically appointed during multi-campus
       reviews, are agreed on a case-by-case basis and defined in their contract. In all cases, the
      Panel Chairperson has overall responsibility for chairing the ISA.

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

13   Observers on ISA Panels

      From time to time, OAAAQA staff members are invited to observe the ISA process for the
      purposes of professional development. Staff from other regional or international quality
      assurance agencies or relevant organisations (including those with which the OAAAQA has
      a formal Memorandum of Understanding) may observe an OAAAQA EQA. The practice of
       permitting observers is well established internationally and is an important means by which
      knowledge and experience regarding external quality review can be shared. The OAAAQA
       permits up to one external Observer for each ISA Panel. To ensure that the presence of an
      Observer does not in any way compromise the integrity of the ISA, however, the conditions
       set out below apply. Members of the public are not permitted to observe an ISA to protect
       the HEI’s confidentiality.

13.1   Observer’s Role and Access to Information

        In order for the position of Observer to be as beneficial as possible, the OAAAQA provides
       the Observer with access to the ISAA and the list of evidence submitted. In order to minimise
       the burden on the HEI and recognising that the Observer is not tasked with scrutinising
       materials for external review purposes, the Observer does not receive the actual MMs and
      SMs.

      The Observer may attend the Preliminary Meeting (in person or by teleconference) and the
      ISA Visit and be present at all interview sessions and ISA Panel review and discussion
       sessions. The Panel Chairperson reserves the right to require the Observer to absent him or
        herself from any session where his or her presence may otherwise be problematic, but it is
      expected that this will only be done in exceptional circumstances.

      The Observer receives a copy of all versions of the ISA Report so that they may experience
     how the versions change at each stage in the process. However, they do not participate in
       the Panel’s deliberations on the ratings or the report drafting process. The Observer may not
        participate in any disputes or Appeals process. The Observer’s involvement concludes when
       the final Accreditation Outcome is published.

13.2  Conduct of Observers

      The Observer is not a Member of the ISA Panel and has no formal role in relation to the ISA.
      The Observer may not influence the ISA Panel or the HEI in any way during the ISA.

      The Observer must remain silent during all the interviews, the feedback and Panel review,
      and the discussion sessions. The Observer may not take notes on content or use any
       recording devices during any of the Panel’s interview or feedback sessions; however, notes
      on the process and procedural matters may be taken. The Observer may take notes about
       the ISA process during Panel-only sessions, including the Preliminary Meeting and ISA Visit
      Panel review sessions, but he/she is not permitted to take notes about the ISA Panel’s
       deliberations on the HEI nor about the HEI itself.  It must be clearly understood that the
      purpose for having Observers is to share information about the ISA process, and not about
       the HEI.

       During the ISA, the Observer may have questions about the process. These should be put
        to the RD during appropriate breaks in the process. The Observer must not under any
       circumstances liaise with the HEI at any point during the ISA.

13.3   Administrative Arrangements for Observers

      Observers (excluding OAAAQA staff members) are responsible for the costs of their own
       meals, travel and accommodation, although the PSO may assist with bookings. The

                                              Page 84 of 121

--- Page 88 ---
Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

     OAAAQA is not liable for any other costs associated with the Observer’s involvement with
       the ISA, unless otherwise agreed by both parties.

14   Administrative Matters and Support for the ISA Panel

       This section contains information about the administrative support provided to the ISA Panel
      and the arrangements in place for the Panel Members’ honoraria, travel, accommodation,
      meals and insurance. Panel Members should direct all questions related to these matters to
       the Panel Support Officer, rather than the RD.

14.1  Panel Support Officer

        In addition to the RD, every ISA has a dedicated Panel Support Officer (PSO) who is
       responsible for the provision of administrative support to the Panel and to the RD. For the
      purposes of the ISA, the PSO works under the instruction of the RD. The role of the PSO is
        to facilitate the logistics of the ISA such as travel, accommodation and other administrative
       tasks related to the assessment. The PSO may attend the ISA Visit, if required. However,
       the PSO is not a member of the ISA Panel and may not influence the ISA Panel or the HEI
        in any way.

14.2  Panel Members’ Honoraria

      Each Panel Member receives an honorarium. The sum of the honorarium is approved by the
     OAAAQA Board and other higher authorities. External Reviewers are notified of the sum and
       the payment terms in the OAAAQA Service Provision Contract for EQA Activities. Panel
      Members are responsible for providing their bank account details to the PSO to facilitate
      payment of the honorarium upon completion of the ISA. Any tax liabilities associated with the
      honorarium rests in full with the ISA Panel Member.

14.3  Panel Members’ Travel, Accommodation, Meals and Insurance

         All travel for Panel Members related to the ISA is in business class by the most direct and
      economical route. The PSO makes the necessary arrangements based on this principle. For
      most Panel Members, including some locally-based Members, the ISA Visit takes place away
       from their home. The PSO is responsible for arranging suitable hotel accommodation and all
      Panel meals for the days of the Visit. The OAAAQA normally funds accommodation from the
        night before Day 0 (the first official day of the ISA Visit) to the day immediately after the end
        of the ISA Visit and any additional nights that are incurred as an unavoidable consequence
        of the  travel arrangements. Specific information about a Panel Members’  travel and
      accommodation arrangements is provided in the OAAAQA Service Provision Contract for
     EQA Activities.

            It is understood that international Panel Members may wish to extend their time in Oman for
       personal reasons such as tourism. The OAAAQA welcomes this interest in Oman and will
      endeavour to provide some helpful advice as required, but regretfully advises that any
        additional night’s accommodation and any increase in the cost of the flight as a result is at
       the Panel Member’s personal expense.

      The OAAAQA requires that all international Panel Members arrange medical insurance for
       the time that they are in Oman and will reimburse the cost up to a pre-determined limit against
      an original receipt. The PSO will provide more detailed information on reimbursement.

15   Before the ISA Visit

     Some important activities take place before the ISA Visit in order to prepare for and ensure
      a smooth Visit. Panel Members are expected to actively participate in these activities and

                                              Page 85 of 121

       contribute to the ISA. This section provides an overview of the activities preceding the ISA
         Visit.

15.1  ISAA Completeness Check

     Upon receipt of an ISAA submission, the RD conducts a Completeness Check (see Appendix
        B). This may be partly facilitated through the PSO where necessary. The RD checks that:
       a)  All Standards and Criteria have been addressed in the ISAA and self-rated by the HEI.
       b)  All evidence (MMs and SMs) referenced in the ISAA is included in the submission.
        c)  All hyperlinks to MMs and SMs referenced in the commentary are in working order.
       d)  All MMs and SMs are clearly numbered, labelled and accurately indexed.
       e)  All MMs and SMs are complete documents and as described in the title.
           f)   All MMs and SMs are searchable.
       g) The ISAA and evidence submitted appear to be free from plagiarism. However,  if
           plagiarism is detected at a later stage in the process, the OAAAQA Policy on Academic
            Integrity in External Quality Assurance Submissions and other Related Documents is
           applied.

      Any issue identified by the RD during the Completeness Check is addressed on a case-by-
      case basis with the aim of ensuring that the ISA process continues within the indicative
        timeline presented in Table 3.

15.2   Preliminary Comments and ISA Report v1

      The ISAA and all the evidence submitted are circulated to the Panel Members as soon as
       the Completeness Check is finalised. At the outset, every Panel Member must read the entire
      ISAA and consider all the evidence. Each Panel Member is assigned a specific Standard or
      Standards to take the lead on during the ISA. However, this does not preclude a Panel
     Member from being involved in the other Standards. Since many of the Standards and
        Criteria are interrelated, Panel Members are expected to remain familiar with the entire ISAA
       throughout the process. Following their initial reading of the entire ISAA, every Panel Member
      must provide Preliminary Comments and provisional ratings for the Standards and Criteria
       he/she is assigned. The ISA Report template is used to prepare the Preliminary Comments
      and assign the provisional ratings. The preliminary analysis by the Panel Member should
       include the following for every Criterion:
       a)  Observations and remarks on the HEI’s commentary based on the requirements of the
             Criterion and important issues requiring further attention;
       b)   Details of any additional SMs that are needed as evidence to support claims made in
           the HEI’s commentary;
        c)   List of any matters that require clarification;
       d)   List of interviewees (by role/position) who should be interviewed during the ISA Visit;
       e)   Potential interview questions for every interviewee;
           f)    Facilities relevant to the Criterion which should be viewed during the ISA Visit, where
            applicable.

      Panel Members should also note any suspected incidences of plagiarism in the ISAA or
       evidence in their Preliminary Comments. These are followed up on by the RD.

       Preliminary Comments must be submitted to the RD by a notified date, typically within three
        to four weeks of the ISAA submission. The RD collates and reviews all the Preliminary
     Comments and drafts the first version of the ISA Report (ISA Report v1), which is circulated
        to the Panel before their Preliminary Meeting.

15.3   Preliminary Meeting

       Approximately four weeks after the circulation of the ISAA to the Panel, the RD organises a
       Preliminary Meeting for the Panel to discuss the submission. The meeting provides an
       opportunity for Panel Members to meet for the  first time and discuss their preliminary
      comments and provisional ratings. It also enables the Panel to create a sense of teamship
      and ensures that the Panel is clear about the tasks and expectations ahead. The Preliminary
      Meeting is held online using a virtual meeting software application and typically lasts up to
      two hours. The meeting agenda is prepared by the RD with the support of the Panel
       Chairperson (see Appendix C) and circulated to all Panel Members together with ISA Report
       v1.

15.4   Preparing for the Planning Visit

       Following the Preliminary Meeting, the Panel Members identify any additional SMs required
      as well as any matters that require clarification. The RD also prepares the draft ISA Visit
      Schedule and the Call for Public Submissions. These documents are sent to the HEI four
      weeks prior to the Planning Visit and discussed in more detail below.

15.4.1 Request for Additional Evidence

      Panel Members may request additional evidence for a better understanding of specific
      Standards and Criteria. This primarily includes additional SMs that are identified by the Panel
       during their initial analysis of the ISAA in the Preliminary Comments, as well as during the
       Preliminary Meeting discussion. However, the Panel may also request some MMs which it
      does not deem to be adequate or sufficient to be re-submitted as part of the request for
        additional evidence. The list of additional evidence requested by the Panel is compiled into
      a ‘Request for additional evidence’ by the RD. Each SM requested is numbered following the
     same sequence used by the HEI and a clear description of what is required is included. For
      example,  if the HEI submits 390 SMs with the ISAA (SM1 to SM390), any additional SMs
       requested by the Panel are numbered and labelled SM391 onwards. For any MMs that need
        to be re-submitted, the original MM number is referenced in the list.

      The HEI must provide this additional evidence on the day of the Planning Visit (see Section
        15.5). The list of additional evidence is sent to the HEI in advance of the Planning Visit, with
        sufficient time given to the HEI to collect the required information. The HEI Contact Person
     may liaise with the RD by e-mail about any questions related to the additional evidence.

15.4.2 Matters for Clarification

      Panel Members may decide that there are areas in the ISAA that require clarification because
        of ambiguity in the terminology used, inconsistent information in different sections of the
      ISAA, or similar. These are listed as ‘Matters for Clarification’ (MCs) and also sent to the HEI
        in advance of the Planning Visit to address. Typically, MCs are direct questions put to the
      HEI to get a definitive response related to a fact or the status of something. For example, the
      HEI may refer to a ‘Quality Director’ and a ‘Head of Quality’ interchangeably in the ISAA,
      which might prompt the Panel to seek clarification if this is the same role or two separate
        roles. Similarly, the HEI may make a claim in the ISAA that a new IT system is being
       implemented. Since there is a gap of several months between the ISAA submission and the
      ISA Visit, the Panel might ask for a clarification regarding the status of the IT system
       implementation through the MCs. The HEI’s response to the MCs does not normally entail
       the submission of any evidence of SMs unless specifically requested by the Panel.

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

15.4.3 ISA Visit Schedule

      To ensure the equitable treatment of  all HEIs in Oman’s higher education sector, the
     OAAAQA seeks to ensure that the implementation of the ISA process is as consistent as
       possible across all HEIs. The ISA Panel undertakes a typical set of activities during the Visit
        to accomplish this, although the precise order and balance of these activities may be adapted
        to reflect the size of the HEI under review. Within that context, each ISA Visit is unique to
     some extent, determined by the claims made by the HEI in each ISAA submission, and by
       the lines of enquiry that the Panel decides to pursue. The RD prepares the ISA Visit Schedule
      v1 based on input from the Panel Members about who needs to be interviewed. A typical ISA
         Visit lasts five working days and involve approximately two and a half days of formal
        interviews; however, this can be shorter or longer if there are fewer or more interviewees, or
             if the Panel has to visit multiple campuses of the HEI. Where mandated by extenuating
       circumstances, an ISA Visit may also be conducted in virtual or hybrid mode. A sample ISA
         Visit Schedule can be found in Appendix G. Interview sessions during the ISA Visit are usually
       divided into 45-minute blocks, although some sessions may last 30 minutes or 60 minutes.
      More details about how the ISA Visit interviews are conducted can be found in Section 16.3.

      The ISA Visit Schedule v1 prepared by the RD only includes the titles (roles or positions) of
       the required interviewees. This Schedule is sent to the HEI ahead of the Planning Visit to
        ‘populate’ and add the names of the interviewees, at which point  it becomes ISA Visit
      Schedule v2. The OAAAQA understands that unexpected events and circumstances may
       prevent interviewees who have been named in the ISA Visit Schedule from attending the
       interview during the ISA Visit. In these instances, the HEI must make every effort to inform
       the RD in advance of any changes to the ISA Visit Schedule and update the Schedule
       accordingly. All subsequent versions of the ISA Visit Schedule should be numbered v2.1,
        v2.2, etc.

15.4.4 Call for Public Submissions

     An important aspect of OAAAQA’s public accountability is to ensure that the ISA Panel,
       representing the interests of the public at large, can assess the HEI in an independent
      manner. This involves having access to information that has not first been vetted by the HEI
       through a public submissions process. This is done through three distinct channels. The first
         is a Call for Public Submissions notice that is provided to the HEI for distribution within the
         institution (see Appendix E). The HEI must display this notice (in Arabic and English) on the
       HEI’s website and on noticeboards and the RD will verify that this has been done during the
       Planning Visit. The same notice is posted on the OAAAQA website. Finally, the Call for Public
      Submissions is made public through the appropriate means such as social media. The Call
        for Public Submissions includes an OAAAQA email address to which all submissions should
      be forwarded.

      The ISA Panel only accepts Public Submissions where they meet the following criteria:
       a) The submission includes the name, position, organisation (e.g., HEI or workplace) and
           contact details of the person(s) making the submission. This information is treated in
           confidence. Anonymous submissions are not considered by the Panel under any
          circumstances.
       b) The person(s) making the submission must be willing to participate in a telephone
           interview should the Panel consider such a discussion necessary.
        c) The submission may not refer to a personal grievance or single out individual members
            of the HEI’s staff as the subject of complaint.
       d) The submission (excluding any corroborating evidence) is restricted to 1,000 words in
           length (approximately two sides of an A4 page).
       e) The submission must be received within the dates stipulated in the Call for Public
          Submissions notice. Any submission received after that point, however relevant, may not
         be used in Panel deliberations.

                                              Page 88 of 121

--- Page 92 ---
Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

      The Call for Public Submissions does not constitute a statistically valid survey. The number
        of submissions received on a certain topic is not relevant. The Panel may choose to
        investigate, or not to investigate, the matters raised based on the likely merit of the content.
      Where the Panel chooses to investigate, this takes place as part of the overall ISA and does
       not involve investigating the details of a particular complaint.

      The Panel does not make any response or report to the person(s) making the submission
       other than to confirm receipt of the submission. This is usually done through the RD. The
      Panel must triangulate any information forthcoming from Public Submissions before reaching
      a conclusion for inclusion in the ISA Report. This may include directly asking the HEI staff
       about the matter, although if this occurs, the identity of the person making the submission
      must remain confidential under the OAAAQA’s non-attribution protocol (see Section 10.4).

15.5  The Planning Visit

       Approximately five weeks after the Preliminary Meeting, the ISA Panel Chairperson (or a
        local Panel Member acting as a representative if the Chairperson is based outside Oman)
      and the RD visit the HEI at the main campus to discuss the forthcoming ISA Visit and other
       matters pertaining to the ISA. This is known as the Planning Visit. The main purpose of this
      meeting is to discuss and agree on operational matters. As the Planning Visit is a working
       meeting,  it should comprise a relatively small number of attendees. Usually, the HEI is
       represented by a senior leader, the Head of the quality assurance unit, and the Contact
       Person. The HEI may involve other people if deemed necessary but should keep the meeting
       small so that the focus remains operational. If the HEI wishes, time can be scheduled at the
       outset of the Planning Visit for a brief courtesy meeting with the Head of the HEI. The
     OAAAQA appreciates the generous hospitality of HEIs in Oman during campus visits,
      however only refreshments should be served during the Planning Visit because the OAAAQA
       delegation needs to depart the campus at the end of the meeting.

      The focus of the Planning Visit is on the preparations for the ISA Visit, including any special
      needs of the Panel. The Planning Visit is not an opportunity for the OAAAQA delegation to
       conduct interviews nor for the HEI to enquire as to the Panel’s preliminary findings. The
       Planning Visit follows a prescribed agenda, and includes a discussion of the ISA Visit
      Schedule (see Section 15.4.3), a verification that the Call for Public Submissions has been
       posted by the HEI (see Section 15.4.4), and a tour of facilities allocated for the ISA Visit (see
      Appendix D). The HEI is also expected to provide the additional evidence (see Section
       15.4.1) and its responses to the MCs (see Section 15.4.2) by the end of the Planning Visit.
      These can be submitted electronically using the same file sharing platform that was used to
       submit the ISAA and original evidence. The RD ensures that the additional evidence and the
      responses to the MCs are shared with the Panel immediately after the Planning Visit.

16  The ISA Visit

      The ISA Visit is the most visible part of the overall ISA process and typically attracts most of
       the attention. It is important to recognise, however, that it is only one part of the overall ISA
       review. Prior to the ISA Visit, the Panel begins testing the accuracy of claims made in the
       submission through the examination of evidence provided in the MMs and SMs. Three
       versions of the ISA Report are prepared before the ISA Visit commences. The Visit provides
       the Panel with a further opportunity to verify claims and triangulate information through
       examination of on-site  files, the interviewing of a range of  staff, students and other
       stakeholders, and a tour of campus facilities. To familiarise the HEI’s stakeholders with the
      ISA Visit, a Notice for Staff, Students and Stakeholders template is provided for HEIs to
       display ahead of the Visit (see Appendix F).

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

16.1  Nature and Purpose of the ISA Visit

      The ISA Visit is conducted in a positive, friendly, and professional manner as a way of
       enabling the Panel to test the statements, descriptions, commentary, and self-evaluation as
       presented in the ISAA submission. The Visit also gives an opportunity for the Panel to acquire
        further insight into the operations of the HEI through first-hand investigation and personal
        interaction. This allows  for a qualitative assessment of factors that cannot be easily
      documented in written form and includes the viewing of facilities. The ISA Visit is conducted
        in a spirit of transparency, dialogue and co-operation between the HEI staff, students and
       other stakeholders, and the ISA Panel.

            It is important to note that the ISA Visit is not an ‘inspection’. The primary purpose of the Visit
         is to verify whether the ISAA has adequately addressed all Standards and Criteria, accurately
      and completely presented all points of fact, given reasonable emphasis in the commentary,
       included current information, and reflected defensible self-ratings against  Criteria and
       Standards. The methods the ISA Panel use to  fulfil their purpose include interviewing
       stakeholders to compare personal experiences with claims in the ISAA; viewing the HEI’s
       resources and facilities to verify they match those described in the ISAA; and considering
        further documentary evidence and making notes thereof. Where mandated by extenuating
       circumstances, an ISA Visit may also be conducted in virtual or hybrid mode instead of on-
         site.

16.2  ISA Visit Principles and Activities

16.2.1 ISA Visit Principles

      The following principles underpin the arrangement of all ISA Visit activities:
       a) The use of the ISA Visit is optimised through the strict allocation of time for interviews.
       b) The ISA Visit Schedule always includes meetings with students and alumni.
        c) As far as possible, the Panel meets with any given interviewee once only.
       d)  Line managers and the staff whom they oversee are not interviewed together.
       e) The ISA Visit Schedule always includes a tour of learning resources and facilities, and a
          demonstration of key information systems at the HEI.

16.2.2 ISA Visit Activities

       Typical ISA Visit activities include the following:
       a)  Face-to-face interviews with staff, students and other internal and external stakeholders;
          these interviews may include ‘Random Interviews’ (see Section 16.3.3) and ‘in situ’
           interviews (see Section  16.5.6), some  of which  (or  all  of  which, given  specific
          circumstances) may be carried out through virtual conferencing means.
       b) Telephone or online virtual interviews (as required, e.g., with representatives from an
              affiliate).
        c)  Tour(s)  of  learning resources and  facilities,  including the  library and information
          technology facilities.
       d) Reading of MMs and SMs, including those available on-site during the Visit.
       e)  Scrutiny of the assessed work of students that is best examined on-site.
           f)  Private meetings of the ISA Panel, to discuss the evidence received and to reach
          conclusions on the ratings for the Criteria and Standards leading to the Institutional
           Accreditation Outcome.

16.3  ISA Visit Interviews

      The ISA  Visit always includes face-to-face interviews  with  staff, students and other
       stakeholders. Interviews provide an important opportunity for the Panel to corroborate what
       they have read in the ISAA and to triangulate what they have learned elsewhere during the
         Visit. Interviews are often the most efficient way of augmenting or clarifying information
       already provided. While some interviews may focus on a particular Standard, very few
       interviews with groups are likely to be single-topic meetings, and interviewees may, within
       reason, expect to be asked about anything within the scope of the ISA. The focus for each
      meeting is derived from the ISAA, the evidence submitted and the Panel’s reading and initial
       analysis of the ISAA.

     Some general features of interviews during the ISA Visit are as follows:

       a) Number of Interviews: The number of interviews, and the length of time devoted to them
                  , is kept to the minimum necessary to complete the ISA process as planned. Between six
         and ten interviews scheduled over two and a half days is typical for an ISA Visit but, as
           indicated above, each Visit is unique to some extent, and the number of interviews
         depends on the size and complexity of each HEI.

       b)  Parallel Sessions: In some cases, two or more interviews may run simultaneously as
            parallel sessions to maximise the opportunity of meeting interviewees and/or focus on
            specific issues. In this case, the ISA Panel sub-divides and groups of staff, students and
           other stakeholders are arranged into two rooms accordingly. Referred to as ‘parallel
           sessions’, these are agreed with the HEI before the ISA Visit, generally during the
          Planning Visit, and noted in the ISA Visit Schedule.

        c) Number of Interviewees: An interview session may take place with only one interviewee
            but, more usually, interviews are conducted with groups of up to a maximum of eight
           interviewees per interview session. The number is capped to ensure that every participant
         has an opportunity to speak within the limited time available.

16.3.1 Interviewees

      The following individuals or groups are typically interviewed by the Panel during the ISA Visit:
       a) The Head of the HEI (including a brief courtesy meeting prior to the start of the formal
            interviews).
       b) HEI senior management and leaders.
        c) Key person(s) with responsibility for quality assurance.
       d) Academic staff.
       e) Support services and administrative staff with responsibility for the management and/or
           delivery of resources, student services and  facilities (the Panel may hold  ‘in  situ’
           interviews with support staff at their location, instead of the Panel Room; e.g., the library
             staff may be interviewed in the library following a library tour).
           f)  A representative sample of current students, including Student Council representatives.
       g) Alumni (graduates).
       h)  Industry, employer and professional body representatives.
            i)  External examiners or juries.
            j)   Affiliate representatives (if applicable).

16.3.2 The Interview Procedure

      The following procedure is observed to ensure rigour in the interview process:
       a)  Interviewees are asked to wait outside the main Panel Room until the RD invites them in
            to avoid interrupting or overhearing a confidential discussion.

                                              Page 91 of 121

--- Page 95 ---
OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

       b)  Part of the Panel Chairperson’s role is to ensure that no single individual dominates the
          session (for example, by attempting to answer all the questions on behalf of the other
           interviewees).
        c) Where practicable, interviewees meet with the Panel once only.  It is understood that
        many people hold more than one area of responsibility. The Panel, however, seeks a
          broad range of input. By meeting people other than the most senior person for any given
          area of responsibility, the Panel is able to explore additional topics, such as internal
          communication, delegation of authority, and teamwork.
       d) Line-managers and their staff are interviewed separately.
       e)  Interview sessions are confidential, in that the Panel may use the information received,
           but not in a manner that reveals the identity of the interviewee who gave that information.
          This is in line with OAAAQA’s ‘non-attribution rule’ (see Section 10.4).
           f)  The HEI must respect the confidentiality of the process, and interviewees may not be
          coerced or coached in their responses. Equally, after the event, no interviewee  is
          expected to divulge what was said within the Panel Room.
       g)  All interviewees must display on the table in front of them their name and their programme
            of study  (if students) or department and role  (if staff and others). These name cards
          should be printed in a large and plain font (e.g., Arial 72 pt) and be positioned upright on
           the table for the benefit of the Panel.
       h)  Interviewees may not bring mobile phones into the Panel Room.
            i)  Interviewees are not permitted to take notes or use any form of recording device in the
           interview session.
            j)    If conducted remotely, interview sessions must be audible to more than one Panel
        member at a time and may not be recorded, digitally or otherwise, by the HEI or its
           representatives. While the HEI provides the equipment and IT support for remote
           interviews, the OAAAQA is responsible for managing the virtual meeting platform and
          ensuring that only those invited to attend each interview session are given access to that
           session. This is managed by the RD.

16.3.3 Random Interviews

       For the ISA to meet the public’s demanding expectations of HEI accountability,  it must be
       able to show that the data collection methods are, in part, independent of the HEI’s influence.
     One mechanism for achieving this is for the Panel to conduct random interviews with staff
      and students during the ISA Visit (and only at that time). The way this occurs is by an ISA
      Panel Member at some point during the Visit (but not during interviews) encountering staff
      and students in their places of work and study, without intervention by the HEI. There are
        specific rules governing Random Interviews to ensure that they are conducted in a fair, safe,
      and professional manner, as follows:
       a)  All Panel Members must wear name badges that clearly identify their name and Panel
            status.
       b) Panel Members may only seek to speak with staff and students. Visitors on campus may
           not be interviewed.
        c)  Panel Members  politely request the interview and may not pressure people  into
          responding if they do not wish to participate.
       d) The duration of each random interview should be kept short – generally less than 15
          minutes.
       e)  Interviews should take place with individual people, where possible, and conducted
            confidentially.
           f)  Most random interviews are expected to be conducted in staff offices or in communal
          spaces, such as the library, cafeteria, or foyers.
       g) Panel Members may not intrude upon teaching sessions.
       h)  During random interviews, Panel Members may not access secure locations, such as the
           finance  office  or  anywhere  requiring  Personal  Protective  Equipment  (such  as
            laboratories, chemical storage areas or construction sites).

Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

            i)    It is not appropriate for HEI staff to accompany Panel Members during the Random
           Interviews. Panel Members use the Campus Map as a guide but may also need to ask
           the Contact Person (through the RD) for assistance in determining appropriate locations
            to allow for maximum opportunity to meet staff and students.

       Interview responses are recorded on Random Interview Worksheets. These are shared with
       other Panel Members but are otherwise confidential. Panel Members use one worksheet for
      each random interview. The worksheets are prepared in advance of the ISA Visit by the RD,
       using information submitted by Panel Members at the Preliminary Meeting.

16.3.4 Call-Back Interviews

      Time is set aside after the formal scheduled interviews for the Panel to meet people who, in
        their estimation, can assist in finalising deliberations in specific areas. Sometimes, issues
        arise during the ISA Visit that prevent the Panel from forming a final judgement without further
       questions being asked or further data sought. The Panel, therefore, asks to meet specific
       people at the end of the Visit to assist with any such gaps in information. These ‘Call-Back’
       Interviews are different from the normal interview sessions in three respects:
        • The interviewees are likely to have already met the Panel earlier in the ISA Visit.
        • The need for Call-Back Interviews is only established the evening before they occur.
        • The interviewees are informed in advance of the general line of questioning.

      The RD meets with the Contact Person ahead of the Call-Back interviews (this is typically at
       the end of the second day of the ISA Visit) and discusses whom the Panel wishes to meet
      and around which specific topics. The Contact Person then arranges, where possible, for
       those people to be available at the designated times. These Call-Back Interviews are
       normally focused on a single issue, and each such interview is of about 10 to 15 minutes in
        duration. Call-Back Interviews are a very important part of the ISA Visit. It is in the HEI’s best
        interests to ensure that the Panel completes the ISA Visit with all questions having been
      answered to ensure that the Criteria and Standards ratings, the Accreditation Outcome, and
       the  final ISA Report are as accurate and  fair as possible. That said, the OAAAQA
       understands that organising the Call-Back Interviews requires some flexibility on the part of
       the HEI and appreciates the HEI’s assistance in this regard.

16.4  The Interviewee Perspective

       Interviews are a key feature of the ISA Visit. They provide an opportunity for the Panel
      Members to clarify issues, check for completeness and accuracy of the ISAA, as well as
        potential discrepancies, and pursue lines of enquiry in greater depth. They are also the key
     means by which a Panel verifies each of the claims made in the ISAA. This section explores
       the interviewees’ perspective of the interview process.

16.4.1 Before the Interview

      People have different reactions to participating in an interview session for an OAAAQA EQA.
      The experience can be enjoyable or stressful, interesting or tedious, challenging or daunting.
      The following are some ways in which the HEI can help people prepare in a positive way for
        their interview experience without resorting to coaching:
       •   Distribute the information about the ISA Visit (see Appendix F).
       •  Provide a briefing on the process and what to expect.
       •  Assure interviewees that their participation is confidential and is not being monitored.
       •  Assure interviewees that it is not an evaluation of their performance personally.

16.4.2 During the Interview

      The following advice regarding responding to interview questions may be shared with
       interviewees as part of a pre-interview briefing:
       a) Panels are professional  in nature and collaborative  in  spirit, and Panel Members
          genuinely want to hear everyone’s views.
       b) The Panel Chairperson ensures that everybody is given an opportunity to speak.
        c) The interview is not a test, and there is no pass or fail. As such, there is nothing wrong in
           not knowing the answer to a question, and interviewees should feel comfortable enough
            to say so. This is a much better strategy than guessing.
       d) Panel Members are happy to give clarification about questions or explain their question
                    if the meaning is not clear to the individual being addressed.
       e)   It is important to provide a direct and specific answer to the actual question that is being
          asked.
           f)    It is inappropriate to seek information about the Panel’s preliminary views (including
          asking about the purpose of the question).
       g)   If a question does not obviously fit within the area of responsibility of the interviewee, the
          person to whom the question is directed should state this and give any information they
         do have on the subject. The Panel may deliberately be trying to saturate an issue or test
           the results of dissemination.
       h)  Interviewees should only interject  if or when a person asked a question has had an
           opportunity to provide a response and if obvious details appear to have been overlooked
           or  omitted.  Interjection must  only take place through seeking the Chairperson’s
          permission to provide another response.
            i)  The interview time is limited, so answers should be kept as concise as possible.
            j)    It is not permissible to present the Panel with materials. If it appears that some materials
        may have been omitted, then this should be conveyed to the Contact Person and
         mentioned to the Panel during the interview. Such materials may only be made available
            to the Panel through the Contact Person in liaison with the RD.

16.4.3 After the Interview

            It is common in external reviews for interviewees to be left with two distinct impressions after
        their session, both of which require discussion.

         Firstly, it is normal for interviewees to believe that they had insufficient time to speak. ISA
        Visits are intensive opportunities for the Panel to cover multiple topics, so a Chairperson will
       often close down a subject as soon as sufficient evidence has been gathered.

       Secondly, interviewees often feel that the ISA Panel focused too much on process (that is,
       ‘deployment’) and not enough time on results. It is important for interviewees to understand
        that the ISA Panel is seeking information on each topic from a variety of sources. Formal
        results are usually available in reports and other documentation produced by the HEI. On the
       other hand, what people do each day in practice as opposed to what is mentioned in
      approach documents is best explored by asking people about their ‘lived experience’.

16.5  ISA Visit Logistics and Venue

      Most logistic details for the ISA Visit are confirmed during the Planning Visit meeting and
        further followed up between the RD and the HEI’s Contact Person. These details include the
      number and types of rooms required and how they are supplied, and provision for various
      Panel activities (such as lunch and prayer) and other requirements (such as parking and
      washroom facilities). All these requirements are described in this section.

16.5.1 Daily Liaison Meetings

                                              Page 94 of 121

--- Page 98 ---
Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

       During the ISA Visit, attention to logistics helps to ensure that the Panel is well supported in
       carrying out its work and that the HEI is not unduly inconvenienced. At the end of each day,
       the Contact Person and the RD meet to review arrangements for the following day. These
        liaison meetings usually last only a few minutes and typically include the following:
       •   Potential Call-Back interviews.
       •  Flagging any additional SMs requested by the Panel.
       •   Logistics (including security arrangements such as locking the Panel Room).
       •  Any operational issues that may have arisen during the day.

      These daily meetings should under no circumstances be used to exchange information about
       the ISA Panel’s deliberations.

16.5.2 Main Panel Room

      The Panel has much to achieve in a short period of time and needs to work as effectively and
         efficiently as possible. Attention to the following room and interview setup details helps
      ensure that the ISA Visit is conducted efficiently.

       a) Convenient Location: The main Panel Room (where the Panel spends most time and
         where most of the interviews and Panel review and discussion sessions take place) is
          best located conveniently near to other facilities such as the parking area, prayer room,
          lunchroom, and washroom facilities.
       b) Soundproofing: The main Panel Room should be ‘soundproof’ to the extent that
            individuals standing outside the room should not be able to hear the conversation inside.
          Vice versa, any noise or sound outside the Panel Room should not be audible inside the
          room. This can be facilitated by selecting a venue for the Panel Room that is isolated
          from the main teaching and student activities areas. Rooms with large internal-facing
         windows should also be avoided.
        c)  Prescribed Layout: A room with good acoustics and a prominent wall clock is required
            to facilitate the interview sessions. The typical layout of the main Panel Room is shown
             in Figure 4.
       d)  Interview Table: An interview table is required in the main Panel Room with enough
           chairs for each member of the Panel and the RD on the Panel’s side of the table and up
            to eight chairs on the other side of the table for the interviewees. The table needs to be
           large (wide and long) enough to accommodate the Panel’s requirements (such as,
            folders, laptops and stationery) and to allow for ample personal space between each
          Panel Member. There should also be sufficient space between the Panel’s and the
           interviewees’ sides of the table as shown in Figure 5.
       e) Comfortable Chairs: Given the amount of time that Panel Members spend in their chairs
          working at the table,  it is appreciated  if the HEI can ensure that the chairs are of an
           appropriate ergonomic design.
           f)  Observer Desk: If there is an Observer accompanying the Panel, a small separate table
           or desk and chair is required. This should be in a convenient location, on the Panel’s side
            of the room, but where it is obvious to interviewees that the Observer is not part of the
          Panel.
       g) Power Cables: Panel Members and the RD usually work on their own laptops, so
            sufficient access to a power supply is required. This may require the provision of one or
         more extension cables. HEIs must have these available in the Main Panel Room prior to
           the Panel’s arrival on the first day of the ISA Visit. A small supply of AA or AAA batteries
              is also useful.
       h) Computer, Printer, Internet Access and Projector: On a separate table in the Panel
        Room, the HEI should provide at least one computer with access to the Internet and a
            printer with an ample supply of paper. HEI’s must check the paper tray to ensure that it
              is well stocked and the printer is selected as the default printer on the computer, and do
         a test print. Where applicable, the Panel should be provided with appropriate access to
           the HEI’s intranet, local shared drive or Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) on the

                                              Page 95 of 121

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

         computer inside the Panel Room. The provision of a projector and screen is also required.
                 It is likely that the Panel will need these during deliberations, particularly towards the end
            of the ISA Visit.
            i)  Wi-Fi Access: Access should be made available to Wi-Fi within the Panel Room. Having
         a member of the information technology team in the Panel Room when the Panel arrives
            to assist them with the Wi-Fi set up is helpful. The Wi-Fi network name and password
          should also be provided to the Panel in the Panel Room.
            j)  Stationery: A small supply of stationery, including a stapler and a hole punch should be
          provided for the Panel’s use.
        k)  Telephone: The Panel Room should have an internally connected telephone to enable
            direct calls to the HEI’s Contact Person. The extension of the Contact Person must be
          noted next to the telephone for the RD.
            l)  Refreshments: ISA Visits are tiring and intensive exercises, so continuous access to
          refreshments, such as water and juice, tea and coffee, fruit, nuts and biscuits, is much
           appreciated. These should be kept permanently in the room as the interview sessions
         and Panel’s discussion sessions may not be interrupted to replenish refreshments except
         where arrangements to do so during an appropriate break have been made with the RD.
        As a courtesy to interviewees, strong-smelling refreshments (such as curried snacks)
          should be avoided.
      m) Emergencies: The Panel should be informed about evacuation procedures (in the event
            of fire or another emergency) at the outset of the ISA Visit.
       n)  Security: The RD requires a key to the Panel Room to ensure confidentiality of the
          Panel’s work during formal breaks (such as lunchbreaks and campus tours). During these
           periods, the key is generally in the sole possession of the RD, and the main Panel Room
              is locked. The RD does not take the key off the premises. It is left in the Panel Room so
            that the room can be cleaned and replenished overnight.

                                                   Figure 4: Panel Room Layout

16.5.3 Concurrent Interview Room for Parallel Sessions

     Some interview sessions are scheduled simultaneously during an ISA Visit. These ‘Parallel
       Sessions’ take place in a separate interview room, set up in a similar manner to the main
      Panel Room (that is, with sufficient chairs for Panel Members and up to eight chairs for
       interviewees). The room needs to have an easily visible and accurate wall clock, but there
       are no other requirements except for soundproofing. Only one or two members of the Panel
       are present in each session. The RD accompanies the Panel Members to one of the sessions
      and takes notes but does not ask questions.

16.5.4 Round Table Interview Room for Student Interviews

      The Panel generally conducts interviews with students and alumni in a round-table format as
      shown in Figure 5. This format is used to allow for interviews to take place in a less formal
        setting. In these interview sessions, each Panel Member interviews a group  of  five
       interviewees, who sit with the Panel Member around a table. The room in which round-table
       interviews are held needs to have one table for each Panel Member (for example, if the Panel
      has three members, three round-tables are required). Each table needs to have six chairs
         (for one Panel Member and five interviewees). There should be sufficient distance between
       the tables to allow the different interviews to be conducted without undue disturbance. The
      room for the round-table interviews should have an easily visible wall clock, but there are no
       other requirements. No refreshments, other than water, need to be provided during round-
        table interviews. A room with good acoustics is preferred for round table interviews due to
       the large number of interviewees.

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

16.5.5 Facilities for Virtual Interviews

      The ISA Visit may involve meetings facilitated through a virtual meeting platform. Depending
      on circumstances, all interviews may be required to take place in this way where an on-site
         Visit is unfeasible. The management of all virtual conferencing must be facilitated by the RD
       through the OAAAQA’s virtual meetings platform, assisted where necessary by the relevant
     PSO. Adequate audio-visual hardware is required for virtual meetings, and the HEI must also
       provide technical staff to support the use of this equipment on the interviewees’ side
       throughout the entire ISA Visit.

       During an on-site ISA Visit, a virtual interview is typically only held with the  affiliate’s
       representatives and other external partners where applicable. In this instance, one interview
       session during the Visit requires the use of a virtual meeting platform, a screen and a
       conference microphone. These may be made available in the main Panel Room, or the Panel
     may use a different room where these facilities are available to conduct the interview. The
      room needs to have an easily visible and accurate wall clock, but there are no other
       requirements except for soundproofing.

        In the extreme situation of an entire ISA Visit taking place virtually rather than on-site, the
      HEI must sign an undertaking that no recording of the proceedings will take place. If evidence
         is forthcoming that this protocol has been breached, the OAAAQA reserves the right to annul
       the ISA (with all fees being retained by OAAAQA); similarly, any Appeal launched by the HEI
       against the ISA outcomes using material obtained through recording virtual Visit proceedings
         is instantly dismissed.

16.5.6 Campus Tours and ‘In-Situ’ Interviews

     A full campus tour during the ISA Visit is not feasible given time constraints. The Panel will
        indicate in advance which areas of the campus it wishes to see during a brief tour, and the
     RD includes this in the ISA Visit Schedule. Typical locations may include, for example, the
         library, computer or other laboratories, and/or other teaching and learning areas. The Panel
     may ask questions about the facilities during the tour. When a formal interview session is
      conducted ‘in-situ’ following the tour with the staff responsible for managing the facilities, it is
        called an ‘In-Situ’ Interview. These interviews allow the Panel to view a given location and
       the facilities that it affords and also to verify if and how they meet the relevant Standards and
        Criteria. There is no requirement for any special room-layout for the ‘In-Situ’ interviews,
       although the room should be large enough to accommodate the  full Panel and  all the
       interviewees (up to eight). At times, the Panel may conduct the ‘In-Situ’ interviews as parallel
       sessions, as two or three ‘In-Situ’ interviews can be scheduled to run concurrently at different
       locations on campus.

16.5.7 Panel Lunchroom

      The Panel schedules a specific time for lunch on each day of the ISA Visit. An appropriate
      room, other than the main Panel Room, is required for this. It is not suitable for the Panel to
      have lunch in the main Panel Room as any lingering smell of food would be unconducive to
      a professional interview environment. The Panel also appreciates a break from the main
      Panel Room. At the same time, when the Panel leaves the room for lunch, the HEI can
       replenish refreshments if needed, after making arrangements to do so with the RD

      Panel lunches are likely to be treated partly as working sessions during which discussions
      and deliberations about the ISA continue. Therefore, the Panel needs to have lunch in a room
        that allows confidentiality to be maintained. For this reason, it is not appropriate for the Panel
        to have lunch in an open cafeteria or other common spaces on campus. The Panel
       appreciates the provision by the HEI of a simple, self-service buffet lunch. Servers are not
       required in the room during lunch. Provision of international, vegetarian, and vegan options

                                              Page 98 of 121

--- Page 102 ---
   Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

           is generally appreciated, and details regarding the menu, and any dietary requirements of
          individual Panel Members should be discussed between the RD and the Contact Person
         during the Planning Visit (see Section 15.5).

  16.5.8 Prayer Facilities

        Conveniently located prayer facilities for men and women should be provided.

  16.5.9 Washroom Facilities

        Panel Members must have access to conveniently located washroom and toilet facilities.
         Preferably, these should be either within or adjacent to the main Panel Room. Ideally, they
        should be allocated for the sole use of the Panel during the Visit and be gender segregated.
       HEIs are respectfully requested to organise these facilities to be routinely inspected for
         cleanliness and availability of supplies (including the provision of running water, a soap
         dispenser, sanitiser and tissue paper).

16.5.10 Parking

       As some locally-based Panel Members may travel to the HEI in their own transportation, car
        parking facilities close to the main Panel Room are appreciated where possible. Where this
           is not possible, a valet service for remote parking or collection from remote parking by HEI
         shuttle is required.

 16.6  Evidence Deadline

       The Panel may request additional SMs during the ISA Visit. This is typically a small number
          of SMs, and a list of those is provided to the HEI’s Contact Person by the RD on the last day
          of the ISA Visit. Each additional SM is numbered, and a description of what is needed is
         provided. The RD may also discuss these SMs with the Contact Person during the daily
         Liaison Meetings, but the HEI is not obliged to provide them during the ISA Visit. The deadline
          for receiving these additional SMs from the HEI is within seven days of the final day of the
       ISA Visit. It is important to note, however, that the official evidence deadline for the ISA is the
        date of the last day of the ISA Visit. No information created after that date may be included
          in the Panel’s deliberations. This means that any additional SMs requested by the Panel on
         the last day of the ISA Visit must already exist as of that date. The HEI is given seven days
         to collect and submit those SMs, but no new documents created after the final day of the ISA
           Visit may be submitted.

 16.7  ISA Visit Concluding Session

       The ISA process does not allow for any preliminary feedback regarding the ISA results to be
        given to the HEI. The concluding session of the ISA Visit therefore allows an opportunity only
          for the Panel to extend its thanks to the HEI for their cooperation during the ISA, and,  if
         required, to participate in a photographic opportunity with representatives from the HEI to
       commemorate the Visit. Under no circumstances are any findings discussed with the HEI
         during  this  concluding  session.  In  following  with ISA  Visit  protocols, up  to  eight
         representatives from the HEI may be present at the concluding session. The RD should be
          notified the names of those representatives by the HEI’s Contact Person in advance of the
           final session.

17  The ISA Report

       Following the conclusion of the ISA Visit, the Panel prepares the final ISA Report. The ISA
       Report is not made publicly available. It contains summative text of the Panel’s evidence-
      based findings and ratings against each Standard and its Criteria, as well as the Accreditation
      Outcome. The Accreditation Outcome and rating for each Standard and Criterion are
      summarised in the Report and made publicly available on the OAAAQA website. The
       accreditation of an HEI provides public assurance that the HEI has the capacity and capability
        to deliver a high-quality academic provision and, according to the HEI’s context, undertake
       research. The discrete stages for drafting the ISA Report versions are described below.

      There are six versions of the ISA Report in total. Every version builds on the previous one
      and a single template is used to generate all six versions to ensure consistency. The first
       three versions are prepared before the ISA Visit, while the last three are generated after the
         Visit. An important reason for preparing the Report prior to the ISA Visit is to ensure that
       appropriate emphasis is given to the ISAA and submitted evidence. The ISA Visit can be a
       very influential part of the process. However, care must be taken to ensure that it remains a
      mechanism for verifying the ISAA rather than becoming the primary information source for
       the Panel’s deliberations. Much of the value of the evidence obtained during the ISA Visit lies
        in its ability to confirm or alter the ISA Panel’s ratings given to Standards and Criteria prior to
       the Visit.

17.1  ISA Report v1

       This first version of the ISA Report is compiled by the RD upon receipt of the Preliminary
     Comments and preliminary (provisional) ratings (see Section 15.2) against each Standard
      and Criterion by the Panel Members. The RD collates all the Preliminary Comments and
       integrates them into the ISA Report template. This version of the Report is tabled at the
       Preliminary Meeting (see Section 15.3) as an aid for the Panel’s discussion.

17.2  ISA Report v2

       This second version of the ISA Report is prepared by the RD after the Preliminary Meeting
       (see Section 15.3) by incorporating the comments from the Panel’s discussion into ISA
       Report v1. The purpose of this version is to document any germane points from the ISA
       Panel’s discussion during the Preliminary Meeting, and to provide an aid for the Panel during
        their ongoing review of the HEI’s ISAA and evidence. ISA Report v2 is circulated to the Panel
        after the Preliminary Meeting.

17.3  ISA Report v3

      The third version of the ISA report comprises of several versions. ISA Report v3 is prepared
      by the Panel shortly before the ISA Visit. Following the receipt of the additional evidence
       requested by the Panel (see Section 15.4.1) and the HEI’s response to the MCs (see Section
        15.4.2), Panel Members develop ISA Report v2 into v3 by updating the text for each Criterion
      based on the additional evidence and information. Every Panel Member is responsible for
        drafting the text for their allocated Standard(s) and Criteria. The text in ISA Report v3 consists
        of concise, evaluative bullet points with evidence-based justification for the provisional rating
        of a Criterion. Every attempt should be made to conform to the principles set out within
     OAAAQA’s House Style Manual. Panel Members submit the  text  for  their allocated
       Standard(s) to the RD at least seven days prior to the commencement of the ISA Visit. The
     RD compiles the text into a single ISA Report v3. This report is then used as a reference by
       the Panel during the ISA Visit and also updated during the Visit to generate v3.1.

     On the penultimate day of the ISA Visit, Panel Members are asked to reach consensus on
       the ratings to be applied to each Criterion and Standard. (This is why it is important for Panel

                                             Page 100 of 121

Institutional Standards Assessment Manual                       v2                                 OAAAQA

      Members to engage with all Standards, not just those assigned to them.) More information
       about how the Panel arrives at the ratings can be found in Part D of this Manual. On the last
      day of the ISA Visit, Panel Members build on ISA Report v3 by incorporating insights gained
       through interviews during the Visit into the text. The text for each Criterion must comprise
       concise, but sufficiently comprehensive, evidence-based justification for the Panel’s rating
       decision, and be submitted to the RD before the concluding session of the ISA Visit (see
       Section 16.7). The RD compiles this text into a single ISA Report v3.1.

       Following the ISA Visit, the RD reviews ISA Report v3.1. This includes editing the text written
      by the Panel to ensure clarity, accuracy, sufficiency and the use of a ‘single voice’ throughout
       the Report. Detailed feedback and comments are provided to the Panel on areas where
        further work is needed. This edited and annotated version of the Report becomes ISA Report
       v3.2 and is returned to the Panel with the RD’s comments and feedback. Panel Members are
       requested to read-through ISA Report v3.2 to check that any changes made accurately
       capture the essence of the Panel’s original text and findings, and to address the RD’s
      feedback by making additions or amendments. The deadline for returning the updated ISA
       Report v3.2 to the RD is within one week of receiving the Report from the RD.

17.4  ISA Report v4

      The fourth version of the ISA Report is prepared by the RD after the updates made to v3.2
       are received from the Panel Members. In preparing this version, the RD considers the
       consistency of the text against the ratings, singularity of voice, grammatical accuracy and
       alignment with OAAAQA’s House Style Manual. The consistency of content and ratings
       across different Criteria is also verified by the RD. This results in ISA Report v4. There is no
        obligation to seek further Panel feedback on v4 unless there is a discrepancy between the
        text and rating that Panel Members need to resolve.

      ISA Report v4 undergoes comprehensive external and internal moderation to ensure that the
        Criteria and Standards ratings are aligned with the Panel’s findings and evidence, the text is
        internally consistent in content across sections, the tone used is professional and objective,
       there is clarity of expression and flow of ideas, and the report reflects international good
       practice in external assessment. Moderators may note any editorial amendments needed.
      They may not change a rating or the substance of the text. They may only point out
       discrepancies between text and rating and then make suggestions to the Panel as to how
       these discrepancies can be resolved. They do not intervene in any way, however, in giving a
        rating: this is the sole responsibility of the Panel.

       External moderators must sign OAAAQA’s Service Provision Contract for External Quality
      Assurance Activities. This requires them to acknowledge, among other things, that the ISA
       Report and ratings are strictly confidential and that they may not publicly refer to any part of
       the ISA  Report, Standards and  Criteria  ratings  or  Accreditation Outcome.  External
      moderators communicate only with the RD. No direct interaction between the external
      moderator and the Panel takes place. Following the receipt of the external moderators’
       feedback, the RD makes any required editorial amendments to ISA Report v4.  If major
      changes are required, the RD sends the moderators’ feedback to the Panel for their
       consideration. Once the Panel has reached consensus on the major changes, the Report is
      updated accordingly and forwarded to the internal OAAAQA moderators as ISA Report v4.1.

      Depending on the availability of resources, the OAAAQA may contract a trusted member of
       the Register of External Reviewers who has in-depth experience of the Authority’s EQA
         activities to undertake the role of ‘internal moderation’. All internal moderators, whether from
        within OAAAQA or contracted from the Register, communicate only with OAAAQA and the
      RD. The RD is responsible for reviewing the internal moderators’ comments, acting on any
      agreed amendments and referring to the Panel as required.

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

17.5  ISA Report v5

      The fifth version of the ISA Report is produced by the RD by factoring in the feedback from
       external and internal moderation and ensuring that the commentary supports the Criteria
        ratings. An important difference between current and earlier versions of the ISA Reports is
        that ISA Report v5 no longer includes any text or feedback on the Criteria that have been
       rated Met. While the text for all Criteria is retained in the earlier versions of the Report to
      ensure that the Panel has reached an evidence-based conclusion, in v5 this text is removed
      and only a rating is given for Met Criteria. The rating implies that all the requirements of the
        Criterion have been met and the Panel has sufficient evidence to assign a Met rating. For
      any Criteria that are rated as Partially Met or Not Met, the Panel’s findings and text are
       retained in ISA Report v5 with references to the relevant evidence. This approach is a
       deliberate attempt to streamline the ISA process, to allow maximum visibility of issues where
      an HEI is not yet meeting the required Standard, and to make for a more efficient and swift
        delivery of the results of ISA to the HEI. ISA Report v5 is formally approved by the OAAAQA
       before it is dispatched to the HEI for their comments.

17.5.1 HEI’s Comments on ISA Report v5

      The HEI’s comments on ISA Report v5 form a vital part of the ISA process, and a template
         is provided to guide this submission (see Appendix H). This part of the ISA process provides
      HEIs with an opportunity to address any matters in the report with which it disagrees about
       the following:
       •  Factual inaccuracies: The HEI should highlight any factual inaccuracies in the report.
       •  Unfair or prejudiced judgement: All EQA activities involve elements of professional
          judgement, and an HEI may not question professional judgement other than where a
          Panel has been demonstrably unfair in the assessment decision of a Criterion. In this
           instance, evidence must be given to support any claims made.
       •  Omission: The omission of an issue so significant that its omission is unfairly prejudicial
           against the HEI and results in an unfair assessment decision.
       •  Due Process: The ISA process was conducted in a manner that was manifestly unfair
         and deviated from the Manual in a manner that had not been agreed to between the
            parties.

      The HEI’s comments on ISA Report v5 represent the last opportunity for the HEI to influence
       the ISA Panel’s rationale. Any claims must be clear and convincing and fully supported with
       evidence. Any evidence (MMs or SMs) referenced in the HEI’s feedback must not post-date
       the last day of the ISA Visit. The evidence must have existed during the ISA Visit. New
        policies, practices, data and so forth that have been developed since the Visit are not
       permissible. If the HEI submits additional SMs with its comments, they should be numbered
      and indexed following the same convention used for all the other SMs. The numbering of any
        additional SMs should continue in sequence.

      To facilitate the timely completion of the ISA Report, HEIs must give their comments on ISA
       Report v5 by an agreed deadline. Extensions to this deadline (of up to a maximum of 50% of
       the indicative time allowed for HEI comments) are only given in extreme circumstances
      beyond the control of the HEI and at the discretion of OAAAQA. Failure to return comments
      on ISA Report v5 by the agreed deadline and without notifying OAAAQA of any extenuating
       circumstances leads automatically to the assumption that the HEI has no comments to make
      and is satisfied with the accuracy of the Report.

17.5.2 Panel’s Response to HEI’s Comments on ISA Report v5

      The HEI’s comments on ISA Report v5 are forwarded to the Panel for a response using a
       prescribed template (see Appendix I for a sample). All members of the Panel must respond
        to each of the HEI’s comments. The Panel Response Report is shared with relevant members

        of CHEQA and the OAAAQA CEO but is not shared with the HEI. This is to ensure that the
       discussion on the Report is completed in a timely manner, and in recognition of the fact that
       the outcomes are non-negotiable.

17.6  ISA Report v6

      The sixth version of the ISA Report is produced by the RD after factoring in the Panel’s
      response to the HEI’s comments on ISA Report v5. Where this involves a change of rating,
       the whole Panel must be consulted, and a consensus must be obtained. The DG CHEQA
      ensures that a rationale for each Panel response to each of the HEI’s comments has been
       adequately given, and ISA Report v6 is sent to the CEO’s Office for final approval. The
     OAAAQA CEO determines the final Accreditation Outcome and ratings against the Standards
      and Criteria, based on a review of ISA Report v6 and discussion with the DG CHEQA on
       relevant aspects of the ISA process. The OAAAQA Institutional Accreditation Outcome is
         final.

17.7   Final ISA Report

      The ISA Report, along with the Accreditation Outcome and ratings of Standards and Criteria
       are sent to the OAAAQA Board for endorsement. Following this, the final ISA Report,
       including changes requested by the OAAAQA CEO (if any), is sent to the HEI under embargo
        for ten days.  If the HEI does not lodge an appeal (see Section 19.2), the Accreditation
      Outcome and ratings are made public on the OAAAQA website. The final ISA Report is not
     made publicly available but is circulated as a confidential document to OAAAQA Board, the
       Cabinet, the HEI’s supervising Ministry or entity  (if applicable), and to other government
       bodies on request, subject to the OAAAQA CEO’s approval.

18   After the ISA

      The ISA formally ends with the publication of the Accreditation Outcome on the OAAAQA
       website. However, a number of ‘closing’ activities take place following the ISA, which are
       described below.

18.1   Public Reporting and Accountability

      The OAAAQA publishes the Institutional Accreditation Outcome on its website, together with
       the publication of ratings for each Standard and its associated Criteria. The OAAAQA is
      committed  to  transparent and  effective communication  of an  HEI’s performance  to
       stakeholders, as realised through the ISA rating scales (see Part D). Stakeholders, such as
       supervising ministries, employers, students and the general public, are able to use this data
        in order to compare the performance of different HEIs.

       Rather than producing a ranking system, the OAAAQA’s approach allows prospective
       students, their parents and other stakeholders to search against items that match their
        specific needs. This approach to the reporting of ISA results enables HEIs to build their own
        profile and make claims, which are supported by the OAAAQA, about the academic
       standards and quality at their institution, and their ability to provide quality education services
      and experiences. It also enables students and other stakeholders to compare HEIs based on
        their own priorities.

18.2   Institutional Accreditation Certificate Ceremony and Media Management

     An Institutional Accreditation certificate is awarded to Accredited HEIs. The certificate is
       presented to the HEI in a ceremony and is valid for a period of five years. The HEI must also
       sign a declaration at this time undertaking to notify the OAAAQA of any major changes during

                                             Page 103 of 121

        this period, as per the stipulations in the OAAAQA Policy on Major Change Notification for
       Higher Education External Quality Assurance Activities.

      The Chair of the OAAAQA Board and/or the CEO or DG CHEQA may make public statements
      on behalf of the OAAAQA  if necessary in relation to the ISA. The HEI may make its own
      comments about the ISA but may not use the ISA Report in a misleading way or to publicly
      harm other HEIs. As the ISA Report is not made public, the HEI is not permitted to publish
      any part of the report. If the HEI publishes any part of the report, the OAAAQA will make the
      whole report publicly available. Any disputes about the ISA process need to be addressed
       through the Appeal process (see Section 19.2). Disputes should not be pursued through the
       media.

18.3   Deleting ISA Documentation

      The ISA is considered officially completed after the public release of the final Accreditation
      Outcome on the OAAAQA website. If the HEI lodges an appeal, the OAAAQA defers the
        publication of the final Accreditation Outcome. The RD will notify the ISA Panel if an appeal
         is submitted. Since ISA Panel Members may be interviewed by the Appeals Committee, any
      documentation related to the ISA should be retained until after the appeal has been resolved
      and the final Accreditation Outcome is released. Following this, Panel Members must delete
          all documents and materials related to the HEI and the ISA.

18.4  Feedback Mechanisms

      The OAAAQA is committed to the continuous improvement of its own processes and routinely
      seeks feedback from various sources after each ISA. All post-ISA evaluations are periodically
       reviewed as part of OAAAQA’s Internal Quality Management System. The outcomes of these
       reviews are treated as opportunities for improvement as reflected in amendments to this
      Manual, indicative timelines, templates and other details of the process. The OAAAQA itself
         is subject to external review from time to time in accordance with the INQAAHE ISGs.

18.4.1 ISA Panel Member Evaluation

        After the ISA Report and Accreditation Outcome have been endorsed by the OAAAQA Board,
       the RD sends each ISA Panel Member an evaluation form seeking their feedback about the
      ISA Manual, the ISA Report, the ISA process in general, and the support provided by
     OAAAQA staff.

18.4.2 HEI Representative Evaluation

        After the Accreditation Outcome has been publicly released, the OAAAQA seeks feedback
       from HEI representatives on the ISA Manual, the ISA process and the ISA Report. This
      feedback is an important means for the OAAAQA to ensure that the ISA remains robust and
       appropriate.

18.4.3 Review Director Report

      The RD prepares a confidential report providing an account of the ISA. The purpose of this
        report is to help the OAAAQA identify opportunities for improvement of the ISA process. The
        report includes the following:
       a) Suggested amendments to the ISA Manual and processes.
       b) Comments on the effectiveness of the ISA Panel, including a review of each Panel
         Member’s contribution and a recommendation regarding their future role,  if any, in
        OAAAQA’s EQA processes.
        c) Comments on the interactions with the HEI.

19   Disputes and Appeals

       This section provides a brief overview of the arrangements in place in case of any disputes
       during the ISA, and the procedures relating to appeals.

19.1  Disputes

      Every attempt should be made by the HEI, Panel and RD to ensure that the ISA is conducted
        in a positive and professional manner. Where, for whatever reason, this high standard is
      compromised, a dispute or complaint may arise.

19.1.1 Complaints by the HEI Against the ISA Panel

       During the ISA, and particularly during the ISA Visit, it is possible that the HEI may believe
        that there are grounds to complain about the behaviour of the ISA Panel. Grounds for such
      a complaint may include:
       a) An unnecessarily hostile or aggressive manner.
       b) A perceived breach of the confidentiality of particularly sensitive information.
        c)  Unreasonable demands on the HEI by the Panel.
       d) Any other perceived breach of the ISA Protocols.

19.1.2 Complaints by the ISA Panel Against the HEI

       During the ISA, and particularly during the ISA Visit,  it is possible that the ISA Panel may
       believe that there are grounds to complain about the behaviour of the HEI. Grounds for such
      a complaint may include:
       a)  Refusal to comply with reasonable requests for access to personnel, information and/or
            locations.
       b)  Perceived coaching by the HEI, designed to influence responses given by interviewees.
        c)  Perceived breach by the HEI of the confidentiality of the Panel’s information and
            deliberations.
       d) Any other perceived breach of the ISA protocols as described in this Manual and related
       OAAAQA policies.

19.1.3 Resolution of Complaints

      The objective of raising such issues is to enable the ISA to proceed in a professional manner.
        In the first instance, the Panel should try to resolve any problems with the HEI as quickly and
      as informally as possible through discussions between the RD and the Contact Person. In
      most cases, positive and professional discussions are sufficient to resolve disputes. In the
        unlikely event that this does not occur, then the RD may ask the DG CHEQA or the OAAAQA
     CEO to intervene. Given that the OAAAQA has a legal mandate to conduct accreditation,
      any clear breach of the ISA protocols or processes as set out in this ISA Manual may lead to
       the ISA being terminated early.

19.2  Appeals

      There are many checkpoints in the ISA process designed to ensure that the Institutional
       Accreditation Outcome is based on a fair and reasonable assessment of the HEI in relation
        to the national Standards and Criteria. It is possible, however, that the HEI may still believe
        that  it has evidence to suggest that the Standard and Criteria ratings or Accreditation
      Outcome are unjust and may unfairly damage its reputation. Only in these cases, may an
      HEI apply for a formal appeal. Detailed information about the appeals process can be found
        in the Appeals Manual available on the OAAAQA website.

19.2.1 Grounds for Appeal

      The grounds for appealing against an Accreditation Outcome are as follows:
       a)  Significant factual inaccuracies that the HEI has  tried to correct by providing the
           appropriate evidence to the Panel in the HEI’s comments on ISA Report v5.
       b) Emphases or perspectives taken by the Panel that are unfairly prejudicial against the HEI
         and resulted in an unfair assessment of a Standard or related Criteria.
        c) The omission of an issue so significant that its omission is unfairly prejudicial against the
         HEI and resulted in an unfair assessment of a Standard or related Criteria.
       d) The ISA process being conducted in a manner that was manifestly unfair and deviated
          from the ISA Manual in a manner that had not been agreed upon by both parties.
       e) The Accreditation Outcome and/or ratings are manifestly at odds with the final ISA
          Report.

19.2.2 Conditions for Reviewing an Appeal

        In order for the application to proceed to the Appeals Committee, the Chair of the Appeals
      Committee must be satisfied (without reaching a conclusion about the appeal itself) that:
       a) The matter is significant enough to have resulted in an unreasonable ISA Report and
           Accreditation Outcome. In other words, trivial issues are not accepted for an appeal.
       b) The HEI has already attempted to correct the issue by providing the Panel with
           appropriate evidence during the normal course of the ISA. In other words, if the HEI did
           not provide the information in the HEI’s Comments on ISA Report v5 before the deadline,
                    it cannot complain afterwards that the ISA Panel reached an unfair conclusion.

19.2.3 Appeal Process, Fee and Outcome

     An HEI must signal its intention to appeal within ten working days from receipt by the HEI of
       the  Institutional  Accreditation Outcome   if   it wishes  to suspend the  ratings and the
       Accreditation Outcome until the end of the appeal. Upon receipt of this application, the
     OAAAQA defers publication of the Accreditation Outcome until either the application has
      been rejected without proceeding to the Appeals Committee or,  if  it is accepted, until the
      Appeals Committee has  completed  its  deliberations. Even  after  publication  of  the
       Accreditation Outcome on the OAAAQA website, an HEI has the right to appeal the result of
       the Accreditation Outcome up to 60 days from the time  it is notified of the Accreditation
      Outcome by the OAAAQA.

      The formal costs of convening an Appeals Committee are structured to ensure that
        application for an appeal is lodged with appropriate seriousness. The fee for lodging an
       appeal is non-refundable. The outcome of an Appeal is final, and there is no recourse to legal
        action.

                        Submission Completeness Check

OAAAQA Review Directors (RDs) must ensure that the HEI’s ISA submission is complete. They do this using
the checklist below. HEIs use the same checklist to ensure that the information submitted is complete and
appropriately presented. Once the Completeness Check has been conducted, and  all elements of the
application have been sighted by the RD, the submission is forwarded to the ISA Panel. Where elements of
the submission are missing, the RD will contact the HEI’s nominated Contact Person and request that the
material(s) be submitted as soon as possible.

                        SAMPLE Planning Visit Agenda

Typically, only the Review Director (RD) and a representative of the Panel Chairperson (‘OAAAQA delegation’)
attend the Planning Meeting. This takes place in person at the HEI’s premises, briefly with the HEI’s CEO (or
equivalent) and thereafter with the HEI’s Contact Person and representatives (‘HEI Team’). This agenda may
be modified (including the duration of different activities) at the discretion of the Panel Chairperson and on the
advice of the RD. All attendees should be familiar with the ISAA, the ISA Manual and the documents assembled
for discussion in this meeting. While the OAAAQA delegation appreciates light refreshments during the
meeting, it does not generally stay to share lunch with the HEI Team.

What is a Public Submission?
The Oman Authority for Academic Accreditation and Quality Assurance of Education (OAAAQA) undertakes
reviews of the activities of higher education institutions (HEIs), for all External Quality Assurance (EQA)
activities under its remit. These include General Foundation Programme Quality Audit (GFPQA), Institutional
Standards Assessment (ISA) and Programme Standards Assessment (PSA). As part of their deliberations, the
Panels undertaking these reviews invite submissions from interested parties.

Who may make a Public Submission?
Anyone with direct knowledge of the HEI under review may make a comment.

What should be commented on in a Public Submission?
Submissions may cover any issue relevant to the HEI’s ongoing review by OAAAQA. The submission should
address, however, aspects of activities or systems that may assist the Panel in forming conclusions about the
HEI’s performance. It must contain specific evidence for any claims being made as a Panel is not able to
pursue vague statements or allegations.

What is the deadline for making a Public Submission?
Submissions must be received by [insert date].

How is a Public Submission lodged with OAAAQA?
Submissions should be sent via the link given at the top of this notice.

What information must be provided with a Public Submission?
•   Identification: Submissions must include the name, position, organisation or workplace (if any) and the
    contact details of the person or group making the submission.
•   Contact: The person or group making the submission must be willing to participate in a telephone interview
    with the Panel if deemed necessary.
•   Evidence: The submission should address aspects of the [HEI’s] activities that can assist the Panel in
    forming conclusions about whether Standards have been met. It should contain specific evidence for any
    claims being made. Vague statements or allegations are not pursued by the Panel.
•  The submission should not refer to personal grievances or single out individual members of staff within the
   HEI under review as the Panel has no mandate to address grievances.
•  The submission (excluding corroborating evidence) should be no more than 1,000 words.

Will the HEI know the identity of those making a Public Submission?
All submissions are confidential. This means that while Panels may use the information provided in a
submission, they are not permitted to reveal the source of the comments. As information is only used in the
formation of general comments on an HEI’s performance, and not for the purpose of pursuing specific
grievance, the Panel will not make any response or report back to those making the submission.

What is Institutional Standards Assessment (ISA)?
The Oman Authority for Academic Accreditation and Quality Assurance of Education (OAAAQA) has convened
an Institutional Standards Assessment (ISA) Panel to undertake an ISA of [HEI]. The ISA evaluates whether
[HEI] meets the OAAAQA’s academic Standards and Criteria, which have been set to reflect international
standards for higher education institutions. The OAAAQA’s Standards, embedded in Part B of the ISA Manual,
are available on the OAAAQA website (www.oaaaqa.gov.om).

What are the outcomes of ISA?
The ISA involves a comprehensive self-assessment by [HEI], resulting in an ISA Application. This is followed
by an external review by an ISA Panel appointed by the OAAAQA. The process results in the [HEI] being given
ratings against the Standards and Criteria, and an overall Accreditation Outcome. The ratings and the
Accreditation Outcome are then published on the OAAAQA’s website.

Who are the ISA Panel Members?
The ISA Panel comprises senior academic, professional or industrial experts, resident both in Oman and
internationally.

What does the ISA Panel do during an ISA Visit to an HEI?
As part of its work, the ISA Panel conducts a Visit during the dates shown above. During the Visit, the Panel
will meet a wide range of people, including staff and students and external stakeholders, such as employers
and external examiners. Mostly, these meetings are in formal interview sessions, but some random interviews
may also be conducted.

What are interview sessions?
Some staff, students and other stakeholders (e.g. alumni) have been requested to participate in formal
interviews with the ISA Panel. Staff may be invited to be interviewed individually or in groups of up to eight
interviewees in sessions conducted in the Panel rooms. Staff may meet with the whole Panel or with part of
the Panel. Students and alumni are invited to attend a one-hour long group interview session. Students and
alumni are not interviewed individually but in groups of five in a more informal ‘round table’ setting with a single
Panel Member.

OAAAQA                                                v2                          Institutional Standards Assessment Manual

The Panel may also conduct ‘random’ interviews with staff and students on campus in order to help the ISA
Panel Members gain a broad perspective. At some stage during the Visit, an ISA Panel Member may approach
you on campus and ask whether you would be willing to spend a few minutes with them responding to some
questions. All ISA Panel Members are clearly identifiable from their name badges. You are under no obligation
to participate, but it is hoped that you will assist in order to help the ISA Panel gain as full an understanding of
[HEI] as possible.

What types of questions does the Panel ask in interviews?
Panel Members ask questions about staff and student’s experience at [HEI], including teaching and learning
experience, support provided to students and staff, resources and facilities available on campus, research and
other areas from the ISA Standards. The Panel may seek comments on a broader range of matters, some of
which may be general, and others may be more specific. Interviewees are expected to answer honestly and
based on their personal experience. There are no right or wrong answers, and the interview is not a test of the
interviewees.

Should staff and students prepare for interviews?
To prepare, interviewees involved in the formal interview sessions may wish to read the ISA Application which
can be downloaded here: [insert URL or state location]. Panel questions are based on this Application.
Interviewees may not bring pre-planned answers to the interview. Panel Members examine a wide range of
evidence during the ISA process and use the lived experience or knowledge of interviewees about the
institution as part of their analysis of this information.

Are interview sessions during the ISA Visit confidential?
All interviews are confidential in the sense that although the Panel needs to be able to use the information
provided, it will not do so in a way that attributes the statements to anyone in particular. In other words, the
ISA Panel may reveal what was said, but not who said it. Your name will not be mentioned anywhere. The
OAAAQA expects that all participants in ISA will respect this rule and will not report on what they or other
people say during the interview.

Thank you very much for your participation in this important exercise.

                         SAMPLE ISA Visit Schedule

The tables below indicate a typical and an illustrative ISA Visit Schedule for a single-campus Visit. The Visit
normally commences at 09.00 A.M. on Day 0, with the Panel arriving at the OAAAQA offices or the conference
rooms at the Panel’s hotel for a private Panel Briefing. Interviews with staff and students commence on Day
1. Interviews normally last 45 minutes, although some interviews may last up to one hour. Time is reserved
within the schedule for private Panel meetings to debrief after sessions and prepare for subsequent interviews.
Time is also required for Panel Members to reflect on what they have learned from the interviews, to update
their notes and records, read on-site evidence, discuss their findings and reach conclusions. Random
interviews (where necessary) take place within whatever time is available. Where necessary, some or all
interview sessions may be held virtually. The Visit Schedule for multi-campus ISAs is adjusted as needed in
order to accommodate visits to multiple locations.
